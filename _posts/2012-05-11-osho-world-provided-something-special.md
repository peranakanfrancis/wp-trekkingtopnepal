I have been to Nepal before, and spent many months trekking, with other guides and travel agents but, Osho World provided something special! Deepak and Prakash were fantastic, extremely warm and helpful. I would thoroughly recommended a trek with them as they are amazing Nepali people. The next time I came back, I am sure to arrange my trek with Osho World Adventure.
