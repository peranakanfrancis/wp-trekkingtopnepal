It was a great tour organized in a short span of time. I loved everthing about the tour. The majestic view during the trek the beautiful Rhedodendro flowers were just amazing. The jungle safari in chitwan was very exciting and the sightseeing tour was also very good. We had a very knowledgeable guide escorting us in the tour. Overall the service was good.
