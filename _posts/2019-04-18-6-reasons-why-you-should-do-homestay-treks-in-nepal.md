Nepal’s diverse population with equally varying traditional and cultural approaches can best be explored with interaction with the local population to learn about their lifestyle and enjoy age-old traditions best fits the equation when travelers can live together with the local people. Homestay tourism is best suited for this purpose.

<img class="size-medium wp-image-7726 alignleft" src="http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/16294333972_6db965ae8c_k-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" data-wp-pid="7726" />

Autumn season would be the best season to do a homestay trek. Generally, the main festival of Nepalese people- Teej, Dashain, and Tihar falls in this season. You will have a wonderful opportunity to celebrate these great festivals with local people.

If you dare to do Homestay Trek in Monsoon season, you will have ample opportunities to join the national crop plantation day. People most of the time spend their time in their fields, cropping, and enjoy eating delicious traditional dishes.

<em>Here are some reasons why you should choose <strong>homestay treks</strong> in Nepal:</em>
<h2><strong>Know the Real Nepal</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-7733 alignleft" src="http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/6605890479_8e58456768_b-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="321" height="241" data-wp-pid="7733" />

The homestay tour will give you the real taste of Nepal. Living in the house made up of stones and tiles watching day-to-day activities of local people either cutting grass on the fields or taking cattle for grazing nearby hills, people living a simple life even with eyes full of happiness and pride, is the way how to get to know the true essence of people residing behind the modern development of Nepal.

The life you see here is completely away from modernization. People have no further hope of earning a better modern life as they choose to live a life of peace and self-esteem in the village without much struggle and shortages.

Staying in a homestay will give you some glimpse of that life, and you will see the life beyond the tall buildings of towns. <a href="https://trekkingtopnepal.com/trip/chepang-village-homestay/">Chepang Village Homestay</a> one of the famous homestay where you can see the semi-nomadic lifestyle of people who have been unchanged for years.

Responsible Tourism has been one of the significant ways to collect revenue in Nepal. Staying in the homestay may hugely aid the economy of local marginalized people living in the remote areas of Nepal so that people and place can prosper and develop.

Staying in a very distinct and rural country miles away from your homeland might be a cultural shock. Here, you can explain to the people like in what aspect your life is different. We recommend you to be humble because normally Nepalese people are so simple and most of them may not know about the way you are living.  There’s nothing better than swapping ideas with your hosts.
