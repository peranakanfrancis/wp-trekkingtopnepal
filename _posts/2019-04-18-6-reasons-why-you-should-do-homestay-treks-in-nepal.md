Autumn season would be the best season to do a homestay trek. Generally, the main festival of Nepalese people- Teej, Dashain, and Tihar falls in this season. You will have a wonderful opportunity to celebrate these great festivals with local people.

If you dare to do Homestay Trek in Monsoon season, you will have ample opportunities to join the national crop plantation day. People most of the time spend their time in their fields, cropping, and enjoy eating delicious traditional dishes.

<em>Here are some reasons why you should choose <strong>homestay treks</strong> in Nepal:</em>
<h2><strong>Know the Real Nepal</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

[caption id="attachment_7707" align="alignnone" width="1500"]<img class="size-full wp-image-7707" src="http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/31569350471_470f7eba76_o.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1000" data-wp-pid="7707" /> Farmer Dipa Regmi and daughter sit proudly by their home in the Sirubari village of rural Nepal.[/caption]

The homestay tour will give you the real taste of Nepal. Living in the house made up of stones and tiles watching day-to-day activities of local people either cutting grass on the fields or taking cattle for grazing nearby hills, people living a simple life even with eyes full of happiness and pride, is the way how to get to know the true essence of people residing behind the modern development of Nepal.

The life you see here is completely away from modernization. People have no further hope of earning a better modern life as they choose to live a life of peace and self-esteem in the village without much struggle and shortages.

Staying in a homestay will give you some glimpse of that life, and you will see the life beyond the tall buildings of towns. <a href="https://trekkingtopnepal.com/trip/chepang-village-homestay/">Chepang Village Homestay</a> one of the famous homestay where you can see the semi-nomadic lifestyle of people who have been unchanged for years.

It is understandable that homestay might not fulfill the endorsement of your each and every need, however, hotels cannot complete when it comes to that friendly Home-Away-From-Home experience. Typically, Nepalese people are super friendly that you will make to feel at home and treat you as a part of the family when you are staying with them. You will be served breakfast, lunch, and dinner along with family members and you eat together with them. You will be surprised by the warm hospitality of the local people. <a href="https://trekkingtopnepal.com/trip/ghale-gaun-village-homestay/">Ghale Gaun Homestay</a> and <a href="https://trekkingtopnepal.com/trip/sirubari-village-homestay-trek/">Sirubari Homestay</a> are the places which are famously known for the hospitality of Gurung tribes of people.

<h2><strong>Try Local Cuisines</strong></h2>

No matter where ever you go for, you will be served Nepalese local authentic cuisine, <em>Dal Bhat</em> which is a favorite traditional dish of every Nepali. But the taste of same Dal Bhat may differ from place to place due to the use of varieties of ingredients depending upon the local specialties, festivals, and ethnic groups. You will be served, a bowl of curry, daal, spoon full of pickle, yogurt and <em>saag</em>(green leafy vegetables) usually with <em>Daal Bhat</em>.

The traditional meal may differ from ethnic groups, such as Newari tribes of people at <a href="https://trekkingtopnepal.com/trip/chitlang-village-homestay/">Chitlang Homestay</a> have <em>Khaja set served with Choela,</em> etc.

Responsible Tourism has been one of the significant ways to collect revenue in Nepal. Staying in the homestay may hugely aid the economy of local marginalized people living in the remote areas of Nepal so that people and place can prosper and develop. This new concept of homestays is for the encouragement of responsible tourism in the country.

In most part of the rural areas, women and children are bound within the four walls. So, visiting their place would provide an opportunity to learn the new skill, culture, and the English language exposing with world-class people like you enhancing their confidence level communicating with guests.

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>Gather Lifetime Memories and Experiences</strong></h2>

A hotel can pamper you with luxury if you are in a condition but home stays almost always gift you with exciting stories sometimes it's evident and sometime it'd treasure hunt that ends with a jackpot of information about native people and places also new perspectives.

<h2><strong>Best Value For Money</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

Homestays always give you a much better value than hotels making a once-in-a-lifetime-experience at the most affordable price. You will be valued as a guest rather a customer. You will truly have your own space. Clean bathrooms, bedrooms, kitchens with simple and basic facilities are usually available. However, at the same time, you should realize that you are staying miles away from cities so everything may not be available.

<h2><strong>Learn the Nepali Language</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

Homestay means staying with local; which allows you the opportunity to learn and practice their language. Nepalese people are always so keen to teach their languages to foreigners and willing to learn English with you too.

<h2><strong>Friends for Life</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Here, you can live their life in the same way they are living, so there is a greater chance to make friends that give you a very good excuse to return.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Staying in a very distinct and rural country miles away from your homeland might be a cultural shock. Here, you can explain to the people like in what aspect your life is different. We recommend you to be humble because normally Nepalese people are so simple and most of them may not know about the way you are living.  There’s nothing better than swapping ideas with your hosts.
