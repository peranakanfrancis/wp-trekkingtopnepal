Homestay means staying with local; which allows you the opportunity to learn and practice their language. Nepalese people are always so keen to teach their languages to foreigners and willing to learn English with you too.

Staying in a very distinct and rural country miles away from your homeland might a quite cultural shock. Here, you can explain to the people like in what aspect your life is different. We recommend you to be humble because normally Nepalese people are so simple and most of them may not know about the way you are living.  There’s nothing better than swapping ideas with your hosts.
