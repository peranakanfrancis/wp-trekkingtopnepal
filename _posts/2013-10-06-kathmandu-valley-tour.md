<p style="text-align: justify;">Kathmandu Valley Tour offers all the best and major attractions of Kathmandu Valley and its three cities: Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur. For centuries the Valley has been the bedrock of Nepalâ€™s political, cultural and social transformations. As many as seven monuments have been listed in UNESCO World Heritage Sites for their cultural and historical significance. This tour will take you on an exploration of all these heritage sites and will get you up close and personal with the local communities. We will visit important religious sites and Shivapur National Park for nature exploration.</p>
