<p style="text-align: justify;">Had a wonderful 2 days of travelling through the beautiful countryside of Nepal. Bhaktapur, Nagarkot, Patan, Swayambhu were especially very beautiful. Osho World Adventure arranged our two days short stay in Nepal really well. The guide, Mr. Namaraj Lamichhane, was very courteous and informative. The drivers, Rabi and Binod were very safe and good drivers. Wish you and your team a lot of thanks from us folks from Mumbai, India.</p>
