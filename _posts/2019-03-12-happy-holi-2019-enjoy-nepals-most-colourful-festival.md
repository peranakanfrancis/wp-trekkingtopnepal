<p><em>Holi </em>commonly called <em>‘Fagu Purnima’ </em>in Nepali marks the beginning of spring in Nepal. It is the festival of color, friendship, love, and fertility. With the vibrant blossoms of flowers in the mountain region, the <g class="gr_ gr_22 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="22" data-gr-id="22">terai</g> and the hilly region of Nepal including Kathmandu celebrate one of the most enticing festivals of Nepal, the <em>Holi. </em></p>

<p><strong> How is <em>Holi </em>celebrated? </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Holi</em> is celebrated by splattering the handful of colors over each other, throwing water and family get-together for the recipes such as Gujiya ( an authentic <g class="gr_ gr_267 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="267" data-gr-id="267">holi</g> sweet). It generally falls on the beginning or the mid of the March at the end of the lunar month on full moon day. This year Holi will be celebrated on 20th March in Kathmandu(the hilly region) and 21st March in the Terai region. Elder people, as well as younger ones, enjoy this festival with enthusiasm. </p>

<p><strong>Why is </strong><em><strong>Holi </strong></em><strong>Celebrated?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Holi</em> signs the victory of <g class="gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="8" data-gr-id="8">god</g> over <g class="gr_ gr_389 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation multiReplace" id="389" data-gr-id="389">evil.</g> Back in the ancient century, there was a devil king, Hiranyakashyap, who wanted everybody in his kingdom to be his devotee. However, his own son Prahlad was a wholehearted devotee of Lord Vishnu. Fiercely, he ordered his sister Holika to kill his five-year-old son. Following her brother’s instructions, Holika (a holy boon to fire) sat on a burning fire with Prahlad on her lap. Surprisingly, Prahlad’s commitment to Lord Vishnu saved him while Holika was burnt to death. </p>

<p><strong>Colorful Ambience Inside Kathmandu</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Kathmandu, the festival begins with the raising of ceremonial poles at Kathmandu Durbar Square, nearby Thamel. Worshipping lights are placed on cow dung at the bottom of the pole by the devotees, thus the celebrations kick-off. The energetic crowds splash the colors regardless of a known friend or a relative screaming at you a ‘Happy Holi’, singing and dancing in a maximum volume possible which certainly induces goosebumps in anyone. We recommend you not to miss a Holi if you are in Nepal because the Holi inside Kathmandu would not let you down. It is completely a lifetime experience especially if you are from western countries. </p>

<p>If you decide to experience the truest excitement of the Holi, it’s better if you put white T-shirts on you. It gives you <g class="gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="7" data-gr-id="7">the vivid</g> colors with other shades attires. You can find the reasonable T-shirts around the streets of Thamel or New-road which are produced especially for this occasion. The one you bought for this festival might not be reusable due to its color shades. However, it will remind <g class="gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="8" data-gr-id="8">you</g> the pleasant experience of your stay and enjoyment in Nepal. <br></p>
