<p>Altitude sickness is the major problem when you are trekking in Nepal. It occurs when travels or trekker has been unable to adaptive to place to place where they have climbed.&nbsp; As altitude increases, the level of oxygen decreases (only half of oxygen is noted above 5000m such like in our Everest Base Camp Trek and Annapurna Circuit Trek). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the trekking, trekkers will feel that their breathing increases with decrease in oxygen. If they continue trekking without taking a rest, they might be victim of Altitude Sickness. Altitude Sickness happens when fluid collects in cell around the body as the result of failure to acclimatize. More deadly result can be happen when fluid builds subsequently in the lungs and brain.<br></p>

<h3 id="mce_76">Medicines &amp; Treatments</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Diamox</strong>&nbsp;is generally useful for mild to moderate AMS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dosage: One 250 mg tablet two or three times a day</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dexamethasone</strong>&nbsp;is a very potent steroid used in HACE temporarily to facilitate descent. This drug improves the symptoms but does not help acclimatization. It is not recommended to ascend while still taking this drug even if one is symptom free.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dosage: 4 mg every 6 hours.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Nifedipine</strong>&nbsp;is useful in HAPE by lowering pressure in the pulmonary blood vessels and thereby decreasing fluid in the lungs. This drug also lowers blood pressure. Sildenafil (Viagra) is increasingly being used in treating HAPE.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oxygen is very useful particularly for HAPE.<br></p>
