<p style="text-align: justify;">We arranged a 4 days trip to Lumbini and Pokhara. The hotels and transports were very good and the sightseeing in Pokhara was amazing. We appreciate Osho World Adventure's help to arrange the visit to a part of Nepal we wouldn't have otherwise visited. We hope to return to Nepal in the Future and would use Deepak's services again. Highly Recommended !!!!</p>
