[mytab name='Useful Info']

<strong>Guide</strong>

<strong>Tibetan guides</strong> are reported to have<strong> limited English</strong> and you may not expect a fluent explanation about culture and religion or any other academic topics. He will serve more as a <strong>geographical guide</strong> and will be responsible for dealing with bureaucracies on the way. However, we will try our best to assign you the best guide available though.

<strong>Clothing</strong>

The weather is cold, harsh and dry. You will need enough warm cloths, tennis shoes, suntan cream, sunglasses, hats, scarves, lip guards etc.

<strong>Food</strong>

Your trip includes only breakfast. So, you may want to carry with you energy bars, dry foods like chocolates, cookies etc to eat on the way. Restaurants in Lhasa,Gyantse and Xigatse
serve varieties of cuisines ranging from Chinese to Continental but in other places, you will find basic Tibetan foods.

<strong>Tibet remains</strong> one of the most interesting but least developed parts in the world. With its very short history of tourism, the facilities for tourists though upgraded are still at basic and limited scale. Its limited facilities for tourists are now approaching to a <strong>reasonable standard.</strong>

The road between Tibet and Nepal is not upto standard at places. It is rough, bumpy and full of bends which is often obstructed temporarily during monsoon months. However every effort will be made under the circumstances to ensure a smooth and pleasant trip.

<strong>Altitude sickness</strong>:<strong> Traveling in Tibet</strong> involves high altitude and could be strenuous. Travelers with known  heart or lung or blood diseases should seek doctor's advice before booking the trip.

It is always advisable to drink at least 3 liters of water everyday while on the tour.

<strong>Clothing accessories: </strong>The weather at this altitude remains cool throughout the year.

From October till March, warm clothes such as thermal underwear are required. April till September, light clothes for the day and a warm jacket or a sweater is must for the evenings.

The other recommended items are: personal medical first aid kit, water purification tablets (though mineral water can be bought), toilet &amp; tissue papers, flashlight, comfortable walking shoes, sleeping bag, dust mask, sun hat, sun glasses and sun block cream.

<strong>Food and drinks: </strong>Tibetan cuisine is not exactly the most varied in the world. It is always handy to carry  dry food and biscuits or anything that can be brewed with hot water such as coffee and drinking chocolate.

<strong>Customs:</strong> No prohibition on still and video cameras, tape recorders or radios as long as they are registered with custom officials and are of personal use. Printed matters considered unsuitable by the Chinese govt. are prohibited.

<strong>Insurance Policy: </strong>It is most advisable that clients should have full insurance against medical and personal accidents.

<strong>Symptoms of High Altitude Sickness:</strong>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>Rather than one or two, usually a group of symptoms begin to appear as a person gains altitude. These symptoms vary in intensity and in the elevations at which they appear, depending on the individual experiencing them. The predominant characteristic associated with adaptation to altitude is headache. Usually a headache appears in the evening after a long day of ascending. The headache should be relieved by aspirins and should go away by the following morning. The principal symptoms that accompany the onset of altitude sickness are : headache and weakness, sleeplessness, often accompanied by irregular breathing, particularly at night, fluid retention [oedema], particularly about the eyes or fingers, depending on the degree of <strong>altitude sickness, dry cough, mild nausea,</strong> loss of appetite, ataxia or loss of co-ordination and severe breathlessness at rest.If the symptoms are a mild annoyance then you should rest until they subside. If the symptoms become more severe or do not disappear after a night's sleep, then you should descend until you feel well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>basic treatment</strong> for <strong>severe altitude sickness</strong> is immediate descent: altitude sickness can progress rapidly once it becomes serious. The person afflicted should be taken down between 1,000 to 3,000ft. [300 to 450m.], the distance increasing with the extent of the symptoms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The drug acetazolamide [diamox] has been used for assisting with <strong>acclimatization</strong> when travelling to altitude. Some reports indicate that the drug might be useful in treating the early stages of altitude sickness in addition to its use in prevention. It has been shown that people who had <strong>headaches</strong>, nausea and felt unwell improved considerably within 30 minutes of taking the tablets. The adult dosage is one 250mg. tablet twice a day. The most pronounced and irritating side effect is a tingling sensation which can occur at any site and without warning. The dose can be reduced to 250 mg. per day. It is recommended that the drug is started on the morning of ascent above 10000ft./300m. and is continued until descent or the person feels acclimatised. If you decide to take acetazolamide, please inform your group leader. It should not be taken by people who are allergic to sulphur drugs.Severe altitude sickness affects few trekkers, most know when to stop and head back down. All of our treks are based on experience and are planned to gain height gradually, with days allowed for rest and <strong>acclimatization</strong>. The above brief notes on altitude sickness are to point out what it is and to note the <strong>symptoms</strong>. Prevention is simple; make a gradual ascent and allow sufficient rest at <strong>intermediate altitudes.</strong></p>
