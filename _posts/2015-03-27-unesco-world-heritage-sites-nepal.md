This continued several days. He became very sad so he called the Brahmin and told him that the cow is not giving enough milk. Brahmin after observing the fact from his own eyes then planned with the Gwala to inspect the activities of cow during the day while she was grazing in the forest. Both Brahmin and Gwala hide themselves behind the trees and spectate the activities of the cow. The cow went into the shade of a particular champak tree. To their surprise a small black boy came out from the tree and started drinking the cow milk. Both became very furious and they thought that the boy must be the devil and tree must be its home. So Brahmin cut down the champak tree. When the Brahmin was cutting down the tree a fresh human blood came out from the tree. Both Brahmin and Gwala became worried and they thought that they have committed the great crime and they started crying.From the tree lord Vishnu emerged out and he told the Brahmin that it was not their fault. Lord Vishnu told them the story that he had committed a heinous crime by killing Sudarshan’s father unknowingly while hunting in the forest. After that he was cursed for the crime. He then wandered on earth on his mouth, the ‘Garuda’ eventually descending on the hill at Changu. There he lived in anonymity, surviving on milk stolen from a cow. When Brahmin cut down the tree, lord Vishnu was beheaded which freed Lord Vishnu from his sins. After hearing these words from Vishnu, Brahmin and Gwala started worshipping the place and they established a small temple in the name of Lord Vishnu. Ever since that day, the site has been held sacred. . Even today we can find the descendant of Sudarshan Brahmin as priest of the temple and the descendents of Gwala as ghutiyars (conservators).</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Swoyambhunath Stupa</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Swoyambhunath Stupa is the most ancient and enigmatic of all the holy shrines in Kathmandu valley. Atop a hill in the west of Kathmandu Valley it is also known as the Monkey Temple amongst Tourist as there are holy monkeys living in the north-west parts of the temple. The Tibetan name for the site<em>, </em>Shing.kun means 'Sublime Trees' for the many varieties of trees found on the hill. The local Newari Language name is Singgu, meaning 'self-sprung'. For the Buddhist Newars in whose mythological history and origin myth as well as day-to-day religious practice, Swoyambhunath occupies a central position, it is probably the most sacred among Buddhist pilgrimage sites. For Tibetans and followers of Tibetan Buddhism, it is second only to boudhanath stupa.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://oshoadventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/swayambhunath.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5496" src="http://oshoadventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/swayambhunath.jpg" alt="UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITES swayambhunath" width="417" height="277" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Historical records found on a stone inscription give evidence that the stupa was already an important Buddhist pilgrimage destination by the 5th century AD. However, scholars believe there was probably a shrine here as early as the 1st century, long before the arrival of Buddhism into the valley.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A collection of legends about the site, the 15th century Swoyambhu Purana, tells of a miraculous lotus, planted by a past Buddha, which blossomed from the lake that once covered Kathmandu valley. The lotus mysteriously radiated a brilliant light, and the name of the place came to be Swoyambhu, meaning 'Self-Created or Self-Existent'. Saints, sages and divinities traveled to the lake to venerate this miraculous light for its power in granting enlightenment. During this time, the Bodhisatva Manjushri was meditating at the sacred mountain of Wu Tai Shan and had a vision of the dazzling Swoyambhu light. Manjushri flew across the mountains of China and Tibet upon his blue lion to worship the lotus. Deeply impressed by the power of the radiant light, Manjushri felt that if the water were drained out of the lake Swayambhu would become more easily accessible to human pilgrims. With a great sword Manjushri cut a gorge in the mountains surrounding the lake. The water, draining away, left the valley of present day Kathmandu. The lotus was then transformed into a hill and the light became the Swayabhunath Stupa.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Swayambhunath complex consists of a stupa, a variety of shrines and temples, some dating back to the Licchavi period. A Tibetan monastery, museum and library are more recent additions. The stupa has Buddha's eyes and eyebrows painted on. There is no nose between the eyes but rather a representation of the number one in the Nepali alphabet, signifying that the single way to enlightenment is through the Buddhist path. Above each pair of eyes is another eye, the third eye, signifying the wisdom of looking within. No ears are shown because it is said the Buddha is not interested in hearing prayers in praise of him. There are also shops, restaurants and hostels. The site has two access points: a long stairway with 365 steps, leading directly to the main platform of the temple, which is from the top of the hill to the east; and a car road around the hill from the south leading to the southwest entrance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Atop Swayambhunath hill is another fascinating, though smaller and less visited temple. This is Shantipur, the 'Place of Peace’. It is believed that inside Shantipur, in a secret, always locked, underground chamber lives the 8th century Tantric master Shantikar Acharya. Practising meditation techniques which have preserved his life for uncounted centuries, he is a great esoteric magician who has complete power over the weather. Earlier when the valley of Kathmandu is threatened by drought, the King of Nepal would enter the underground chamber to get a secret mandala from Shantikar. Soon after the mandala was brought outside and shown to the sky, rain begins to fall. Frescoes painted on the inside temple walls depict when last this occurred in 1658. The small temple has a powerful atmosphere; it is mysterious, stern and slightly ominous.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The surroundings of Swyambhunarayan Stupa consists of chaityas, temples, painted images of deities and numerous other religious objects.The temple is dedicated to the goddess of smallpox and other epidemics. The presence of the Harati Devi temple signifies the intermingling of the pantheons of Hinduism and Buddhism in Nepal.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Boudhanath Stupa</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Boudhanath Stupa is located about 11 km (6.8 mi) from the center and northeastern outskirts of Kathmandu. It is one of the largest Stupas in the whole world and the holiest Tibetan Buddhist temple outside Tibet. It is also known as Khasti in Newari Language, Jyarung Khasyor in Tamang Language or as Bauddha by speakers of Nepali. It is the centre of Tibetan Culture in Kathmandu and rich in Buddhist symbolism.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://oshoadventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/boudhanath.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5484" src="http://oshoadventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/boudhanath.jpg" alt="Boudhanath" width="422" height="269" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Legend says that King Manadeva erected the Bouddhanath stupa during the Lichavi period. It has been refurbished many times. The present stupa was renovated in the seventeenth century.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Buddhist stupa of Boudhanath dominates the skyline. The influx of large populations of refugees from Tibet has seen the construction of over 50 Tibetan Monasteries around Boudhanath. Along with Swoyambhunath, it is one of the most popular tourist sites in the Kathmandu area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The stupa has a diameter of about 100m and height of 40m. The stupa's massive mandala makes it one of the largest spherical stupas in Nepal. It has a round path at the bottom while another path is made of three-tier plinth. And the four of the Dhyani Buddhas mark the cardinal points, with the fifth, Vairocana, enshrined in the center (in the white hemisphere of the stupa). The five Buddhas also personify the five elements (earth, water, fire, air and ether), which are represented in the stupa's architecture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The nine levels of Boudhanath Stupa represent the mythical Mt. Meru, center of the cosmos; and the 13 rings from the base to the pinnacle symbolize thepath to enlightenment, or "Bodhi" — hence the stupa's name.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As at Swayambhunath, Bodnath is topped with a square tower bearing the omnipresent Buddha eyes on all four sides. Instead of a nose is Nepali character for the number 1, symbolizing unity and the one way to reach enlightenment i.e. through the Buddha's teachings. Above this is the third eye, symbolizing the wisdom of the Buddha.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The square tower is topped by a pyramid with 13 steps, representing the ladder to enlightenment. The triangular shape is the abstract form for the element of fire. At the top of the tower is a gilded canopy, the embodiment of air, with above it a gilded spire, symbolic of ether and the Buddha Vairocana. Prayer flags tied to the stupa flutter in the wind, carrying mantras and prayers heavenward</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lhosar, Tibetan New Year festival begins with prayers and worship. Thousands of Tibetans dress in traditional attire and dance after expressing reverence for Buddha. Number of Tibetans comes from Laddakh, Sikkim, Bhutan to take part in this festival.</p>
