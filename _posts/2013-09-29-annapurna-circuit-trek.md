<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Annapurna Circuit Trek</strong> is considered as the one of the best treks in the world for any range of travelers and trekkers. Annapurna circuit trekking brings you closer to the magic of rivers, flora, fauna and, above all, mountains. Annapurna Circuit touches the 4 districts of Nepal, namely Lamjung, Manang, Mustang and Myagdi. The route follows counter-clockwise, starting from <strong>Besisahar</strong> to <strong>Nayapul</strong> and reaches its climax in <strong>Thorung La</strong> (pass) at the height of 5416m, or 17,769 feet.: <a href="http://oshoadventure.com/destination/nepal/trekking_in_nepal/manaslu-trekking/"><strong>Manaslu</strong> </a>(an 8,000-plus meter peak), Langtang Himal, Annapurna II and IV, Annapurna III and Gangapurna, and, of course, Annapurna I and Dhaulagiri can be viewed clearly along the trail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The world’s deepest gorge</strong> between Annapurna I and Dhaulagiri will leave you spellbound. <strong>Poon Hill</strong>, one of the vantage point to see the panorama of Himalayas from South Annapurna to Macchupucchre is another high of this trek.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover trekkers can experience deep cultural values and norms of Buddhists and Hindus. Muktinath is a holy site for both Buddhists and Hindus and is one of the focal poins of this trek. And so is Braga, one of the oldest monasteries in the region.</p>
