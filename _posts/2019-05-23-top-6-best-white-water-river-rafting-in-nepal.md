Nepal's rivers offer something for everyone from the calm small streams for beginners to fierce white water rapids adventurous journey to the thrill seekers facilitating the options for paddling, canyoning, and kayaking.

Whitewater rafting is a kind of sport wherein an inflatable rubber boat carries people sturdily down a river with its really robust waters.

That is why people look for places with long rivers running on a mountain slope or a high level going down roughly.
