<p style="text-align: justify;">We are 3 ladies of Germany and actually planned to make the Annapurna Circuit on our own. Luckily we met Deepak and he arranged a perfect trek with our lovely and caring and friendly guide Laxman for us. We made our trek in 18 days starting from Pokhara, passing Throng La Pass and finally arrived in Besisahar. We spent a wonderful time and thank Deepak and Laxman a lot! Definitely we will come back to the country of <strong>N</strong>ever <strong>E</strong>nding <strong>P</strong>eace <strong>A</strong>nd <strong>L</strong>ove!</p>
