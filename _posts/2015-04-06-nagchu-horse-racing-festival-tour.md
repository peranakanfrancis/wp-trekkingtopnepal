post_excerpt: >
  Nagchu Horse Racing Festival is the
  grandest annual event in northern Tibet.
  Tens of thousands of herdsmen gather on
  the vast grassland dotted with tents to
  enjoy the horse riding competition, yak
  race, tug of war, stone-lifting and
  Tibetan operas. August is the golden
  season for tourists to sightsee the vast
  and beautiful green grassland covered by
  flower. During this time, the grass is
  the tallest and the weather is most
  accommodating to those who enjoy the
  great outdoors. This festival is also an
  exhibition and trading of local stuff
  among Tibetan people.
