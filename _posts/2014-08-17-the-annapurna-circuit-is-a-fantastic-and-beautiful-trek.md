<p style="text-align: justify;">The Annapurna circuit is a fantastic and beautiful trek. The tea villages are humble and welcoming, the mountain views are breath-taking and the culture is rich. I did the trek in 15 days with a few days to relax in Pokhara at the end. My guides, Shankar, was fun, easy going and by the end had a long lasting friendship. Helped me when I was sick and kept pushing me and encouraging me. We would also joke and share life stories as the hours went by in the day. Trekking alone was great as well because you could go at your own pace and at night I was easy to form companionship with trekkers and guides alike as we would settle for Nepali dinner at a guest house. Do this trek before the road is built !!! It's a gem amongst the world, but not for much longer.</p>
