<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally he called her sister Holika. Holika was blessed by the god Brahma if she jumped in the fire she will not be burnt. So the egotistical king decided to kill the son so he said to his sister to take Prahlada with her and jump in the fire. Then Holika jumped in the fire but the Holika burnt by the fire and Prahlada is saved. The blessing given by the Brahma could be used for the good and nice purpose. Thus Holi is celebrated as the Victory of good over evil as well as light over darkness and kindness over unkindness.</p>
