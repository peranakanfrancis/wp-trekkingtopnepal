<p style="text-align: justify;">Dhampus Peak Climbing is situated in between the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri ranges which makes this peak wonderful. This peak is also known as the Thapa Peak. Dhampus Peak Climbing involves one of the shortest yet most classic treks in Nepal as it passes through country inhabited by a wide diversity of people. It offers spectacular mountain scenery and takes you north of the Annapurna and Machhapuchare (Fishtail) mountains. This region is heavily settled and farmed. Sarangkot which is situated northwest of Pokhara is an ideal vantage point from which to view not only Pokhara Valley and Phewa Lake but also the sunrise and sunset within the majestic Himalayan range. You will have magnificent views of the Annapurna range.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This popular trek passes through beautiful countryside inhabited by highly diversified communities of people. The Dhampus Peak region is heavily settled by the mid-hills tribe the Gurungs. Gurungs are the famous Gurkha soldiers of the British, Indian and Nepalese armies. This trek offers excellent scenery in the western Himalayan Range to give an encompassing taste of trekking in Nepal in a short amme. Dhampus peak climbing give you spectacular scenery of Tukuche peak and Dhaulagiri, Annapurna South, Annapurna 1,2,3 &amp; 4, Tilicho Peak, Nilgiri South &amp; North.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 3500 meter ascent from Tukuche, where our climb starts, makes you feel having gone really high. The normal route to Dhampus Peak follows the west-ridge, which connects Dhampus Pass (5200m), where Beautiful sunset in the mountain!our highest camp is placed, with the summit. For acclimatized people we have a 6-day schedule starting from the High Plains Inn in Tukuche. For acclimatization individuals we offer various acclimatization programs, which each take an additional 4 days. An ideal combination is the trek over the 5400 meter high Thorung Pass. Though this expedition exceeds the 6000 meter frontier, no technical climbing skills are required. The use of crampons depends on snow conditions. This means any experience in walking on snow/ice is advisable. As there are no steep pitches and no glacier traverses at all, we won’t be roped together. Hence knowledge about knots and rescue operations are also not required. Good physical health and mental perseverance necessary.</p>
