<p style="text-align: justify;">Home to World’s highest peaks, 7 World Heritage sites, birth place of Lord Buddha and home to many species of flora, fauna, birds and many endangered animals, Nepal had open its gate to the world since early 1950's. Nepal has been listed as one of the best tourist destinations in the world. Famous for its culture, traditions, natural beauty and the warm hospitality Nepal was hit by a destructive massive 7.8 rector scale earthquake on April 25<sup>th</sup> 2015 which took the life of thousands of people, left even more homeless and many are still missing. The earthquake was followed by many aftershocks including two of 6.4 rectors and 7.4 rectors which also took life of many. Nepal lost some of its centuries old heritage in the destructive earthquake. It was indeed a huge lose to the country as well as its people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the news spread many countries and people and NGO’s INGO’s from around the globe stood up to support and help the victims of the destructive earthquake and we all very thankful to them. Now as the time passes by people of Nepal has slowly started to cope out of the hard sorrowful time and started living their normal lives. Many have lost their families, relatives, house and many more but the time to moan has come to end. People of Nepal are hopeful that everything will be normal soon as the rates of aftershocks have decreased. People have started maintaining their house, building houses and they have started living a normal life.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Now the big question raises Is Nepal safe to travel?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the earthquake shook the ground of Nepal and as the new spread thousands of travelers have cancelled their plans to visit Nepal which has affected Nepal’s economy as a large portion of Nepal’s economy depended on the Tourism Industry. But now as the rate of aftershocks decrease Nepal has again opened its gates for the travelers, trekkers and climbers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well some people might be questioning that what to see in Nepal as the media had shown that the centuries old heritage site in Nepal is destroyed. But through this blog I would like to inform you about what is left to see and do in Nepal.</p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
	<li>Given the facts that the earthquake has only affected 2% of the total tourist areas as only 8 out of 75 districts of Nepal had been affected by the horrific earthquake, the remaining sites are all functioning as normal.</li>
	<li>Only 1 National Park out of 10 National Parks in Nepal i.e. Sagarmatha National Park has been affected by the earthquake. Other famous National Parks such as Chitwan National Park, Bardia National Park, Koshi Tappu National Park, Parsa National Park and so on are still functioning without any feel of the earthquakes and the aftershocks and are safe to visit.</li>
	<li>None of the airports or highways has suffered any kind of damage.</li>
	<li>Only 3 out of 8 world heritage sites enlisted by UNESCO have been affected. Places such as, Lumbini (Birth place of Lord BUDDHA), Chitwan National Park, Pasupatinath Temple are still upright and welcoming</li>
	<li>Pokhara the most famous tourist destination in Nepal offers a variety of adventure activities has not been affected by the earthquake and is safe to travel.</li>
	<li>Only 2 out of 35 most adventurous trekking routes have been affected by the earthquake mainly, Langtang Valley Trek and Manaslu region trek. Annapurna Region, Everest Region and Mustang Region trek are post-earthquake safe trekking areas.</li>
	<li>Nepal government has reinforced team of engineers for inspecting buildings and marking safety status. More than 90% of the hotels have been marked safe and are open to accommodate guests.</li>
	<li>Restaurants, cafes and all other food places are up and running with maximum standard of service.</li>
	<li>Hospitals, Clinics are 24 hours available.</li>
	<li>Communication channels are working without any disturbance as normal.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nepal is always open for its guests. The earthquake might have damaged some of the famous tourist destinations but there are many more to see. Visiting Nepal in this time is more important because it will not help the country economically but also emotionally and mentally support the affected people.</p>
