Monsoon generally comprises the month of June, July, and August in Nepal. There is a high chance of raining all day during monsoon so normally people do not prefer to do outdoor activities in Nepal during these months.

However, I can assure you that there are so many appealing things to do in Nepal in Monsson. Due to variation in geographical structures, the adventure activities in Nepal can be done all-year-around.

<em>Here I would like to share six of the best activities that can be done during this season.</em>
<h2><strong>White Water Rafting in Trishuli</strong></h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1298" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/trekkingtopnepal/image/upload/v1544804164/rafting-444743_vahge4.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1277" data-wp-pid="1298" />

It's monsoon- rafting time in Nepal! Trishuli at its best right now. Trishuli River is widely known for its stimulation and exciting river trips in the world.

During monsoon, the river transforms itself into a swollen torrent of raging white water and offers brilliant white water action. The trip offers you scenic villages, attractive gorges, exhilarating rapids, and easier sections of river for swimming and relaxing. It creates excitement and heart-pounding adventure when the river is running high.

&nbsp;
<h2>Homestay Tour</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7635" src="http://54.161.43.112/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/5023031755_eba7c71109_o.jpg" alt="" width="2272" height="1704" data-wp-pid="7635" />

Homestay Tours are always based in the rural or semi-rural areas where you are enormously bounded by farmlands, nature, and natural beauty. Monsoon is the famous season to do homestay tours in Nepal. While the wet monsoon months are not peaked tourist season in Nepal, they can actually be a beautiful time to visit the countryside, as the greens of the farmland will be so vibrant and untouched.

'National Rice Plantation Day' usually falls during the first week of June. If you go for light homestay trek in and around Kathmandu Valley like Balthali Village and Chitlang Village during this time, you can join this awesome moment with the workers and can get knee-deep in the fields and join in the important task of planting crops. You can also join the herd of cows and ox grazing around the terrace farming area.

<h2>Adventure Sports in Pokhara</h2>
