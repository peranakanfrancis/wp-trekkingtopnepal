Monsoon generally comprises the month of June, July, and August in Nepal. There is a high chance of raining all day during monsoon so normally people do not prefer to do outdoor activities in Nepal during these months. It is wondrous to experience <strong>top 5 best monsoon activities in Nepal when you are in Nepal</strong>.

However, I can assure you that there are so many appealing things to do in Nepal in Monsson. Due to variation in geographical structures, the adventure activities in Nepal can be done all-year-around.

<em>Here I would like to share<strong> five of the best monsoon activities</strong> that can be done during the rainy season.</em>
<h2><strong>1) White Water Rafting in Trishuli</strong></h2>

It's <a href="https://trekkingtopnepal.com/activities/river-rafting-kayaking-nepal/">monsoon- rafting time in Nepal</a>! Trishuli at its best right now. Trishuli River is widely known for its stimulation and exciting river trips in the world.

During monsoon, the river transforms itself into a swollen torrent of raging white water and offers brilliant white water action. The trip offers you scenic villages, attractive gorges, exhilarating rapids, and easier sections of river for swimming and relaxing. It creates excitement and heart-pounding adventure when the river is running high.

&nbsp;
<h2>2) Homestay Tour</h2>

Monsoon is the famous season to do <a href="https://trekkingtopnepal.com/activities/homestay-tour/">homestay tours in Nepal</a>. While the wet monsoon months are not peaked tourist season in Nepal, they can actually be a beautiful time to visit the countryside, as the greens of the farmland will be so vibrant and untouched.

'National Rice Plantation Day' usually falls during the first week of June. If you go for light homestay trek in and around Kathmandu Valley like<a href="https://trekkingtopnepal.com/trip/balthali-village-homestay-hike/"> Balthali Village</a> and <a href="https://trekkingtopnepal.com/trip/chitlang-village-homestay-hike/">Chitlang Village</a> during this time, you can join this awesome moment with the workers and can get knee-deep in the fields and join in the important task of planting crops. You can also join the herd of cows and ox grazing around the terrace farming area.

&nbsp;
<h2>3) Adventure Sports in Pokhara</h2>

<h2>5) Trekking</h2>
Although the best time to visit Nepal is believed to be the autumn and spring season there are still flow of tourism in Nepal during monsoon as well. Monsoon in Nepal doesn't mean too much rain all the time. The rain falls for a couple of hours during the day leaving a clear, sunny weather for the rest of the day. The rain turns all the scenery into a colorful, lush garden which can be viewed from the warm balconies or rooms of the tea houses.
