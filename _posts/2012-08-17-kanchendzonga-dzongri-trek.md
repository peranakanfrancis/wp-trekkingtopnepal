Kanchendzonga Dzongri trek  is also accessible from the Sikkim, India which offers great combination of culture and spectacular views of Mt. Kanchenjunga, the 3<sup>rd</sup> highest mountain in the world. Moreover the trekking to Kanchenjunga from Sikkim gives astonishing views of other mountains such as the Mt.

<h3>Climate</h3>

<h3>Demographic feature</h3>
The area is thinly populated but there are some age old ethnic groups are the Limbu, Bhotia and Sherpa. Mainly population is that concentrate in the lower parts of the district.
<h3>People and Lifestyle</h3>
People living on the high altitude have been encountering challenges as the place is not at all congenial for human being. There are problems water, communication and other basic facilities. Also the climate vacillate so much that it very tough to survive. Still the place is inhabited by different ethnic groups and speak in different languages and dialects. They are mainly Tibeto-Burman ethnic groups such as Rai, Limbu, Tamang, Jirel, Thakali, Magar, Gurung and Sherpa. Of these, the Sherpa communities generally live in the highest areas, beyond which there is no possibility of human settlement. Main occupation of people is agriculture, Settled, mixed farming; swidden agriculture; middle-altitude agropastoralism; high-altitude agropastoralism, these are the five methods of agricultural practice adopted to sustain in a harsh condition. Mainly farmers cultivate rice, wheat, maize, millet, mustards and vegetables. Pastoralism revolves around cattle, water buffalo, sheep, and goats, There are another occupation where people exchange grains from middle-altitude groups for high altitude resources such as Tibetan salt and wool. People in this group are almost exclusively Buddhist, with a culture and lifestyle closely resembling that of the Tibetan people.
<h3>Flora and Fauna</h3>

<h3>Responsible Travel &amp; Tourism</h3>
Wonderful environment of the Himalayas is also an extremely fragile one. Increasing population density and numbers of trekkers threaten the very beauty of Nepal . As deforestation is one of the greatest environmental threats, we do not have camp fires and use kerosene for cooking as an alternative fuel to wood.

We also discourage you to use wood-fuelled hot showers in lodges along the way. Many lodges, however, now provide solar hot showers, a far more eco-friendly alternative.

Garbage disposal is another major problem and some of the busier trails can, at times, appear strew with litter. Our staff members are well motivated towards eco-friendly practices. We carry out all our garbage, apart from that which can be safely and easily burnt at the campsite. Our aim is to help protect and preserve this beautiful environment for future generations of trekkers to enjoy.
<h3>Trip Extensions</h3>
We can help you to extend your trip if you are interested to trek more both within and other neighboring countries. You can try rafting or you may go for Jungle safari in Nepal or you can enjoy Nepal cultural tour. You can also go for trek in Tibet , India and Bhutan . After the trek ends in Pokhara, you are strongly advised to spend few more days in exploring sights and sounds of the this beautiful city.

All staffs and porters are equipped with adequate clothing and equipments.

<h3>What does grading (Easy, Moderate, Adventurous, Challenging) means?</h3>
"Grading" is a term used for rating treks based on difficulty. We have four grade of trekking i.e. Easy, Moderate, Adventurous and Challenging- the challenge in terms of both technicality and geography increases as we move higher in that order.
<blockquote><strong>Easy Treks</strong>

No previous trek experience and any physical preparation are required to attempt this trek. An interest in walking will be enough to take up such treks. Such treks usually vary from 2 days hike to 5 days trekking and can reach up to an altitude of 3000 m.

<strong>Moderate Treks</strong>

Moderate Treks need at least 6-7 hours of daily walking every day which crosses 4000 m above high altitude passes, and long and exhausting walks through often rough trails, rocks and boulders.

<strong>Adventurous Treks</strong>

Adventurous treks required previous trekking experience and technical knowledge. Besides this 6-7 hours walking through rough trails and crossing high passes as high as 5000 m.

<strong>Challenging Treks</strong>

These are long days trekking with long hours challenging walks passing through high altitude above 5000 m, difficult terrains and glacier and snow walking. No doubt you need to be mentally and physically fit and in excellent health condition.</blockquote>
<h3>What is altitude sickness?</h3>
Altitude sickness is also known as Acute Mountain Sickness which generally occurs when people ascend too quickly in altitudes of over 3000 m. Altitude sickness is the major problem when you are trekking. And it is really necessary for you to study the causes, symptoms and treatment of the attitude sickness before trekking and climbing. Average of three peoples per year dies due to the Altitude sickness.

While trekking and climbing it is necessary adjust your schedule for trekking in above 3.000 meters. It is better if you climb no more than 400 meters per day when you are climbing above 3000 meters. If you fail to allow time for adaptation, you may develop the symptoms of Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS). You can easily care it with a day’s rest or if ignored can lead to death. So before trekking especially in higher altitude, basic awareness of AMS is necessary for safe trek.
<h3>What happens if there’s an emergency?</h3>
Generally, you are not likely to face any emergency but if the situation goes serious, then you can send word to the nearby village with radio service for a helicopter evacuation. It can cost you up to $1500-$2500 (even more depending upon the situation) for a helicopter evacuation and it requires a guarantee of payment before the helicopter takes off. If you register with your embassy, then this process can be done in great speed. However, if the case is not so serious, then you can find some health posts or air field for check-up. So, we recommend you to have necessary travel insurance which can cover all those expenses.
<h3>Is there an emergency contact number?</h3>
Yes. You can dial on <strong>9751000991</strong> anytime from anywhere. If you are using international number you need to put our country code 00977 or if you are dialing from local number in Kathmandu, doesn’t need to put any code.
<h3>Do I need to tip my guide and porters? How much would that be?</h3>
This is very difficult thing to determine. We have seen everything from 10USD to 500 USD per person for guides and porters. Tipping is not required, but a small way to show your guides and local porters thanks for their help. The level of the tip should reflect the level of personal involvement with your guide.
<h3>How can I book my trip in advance?</h3>
If you are traveling in high tourist season i.e. between October to November and March to April, you have to book the tour six to ten months before. Because of the limitation of the infrastructure in tourism industry, you are asked to book the trip in advance.
<h3>What is the mode of payment?</h3>
We accept major credit cards such as VISA, Master and American Express. You can use any of above credit card to pay us. You can also pay us either by Western Union Money Transfer or PayPal or Direct Bank Transfer.
<h3>I want to extend my trip any recommendation?</h3>
