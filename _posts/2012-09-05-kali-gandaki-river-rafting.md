<p style="text-align: justify;" align="left">Kali Gandaki river rafting is another short and most exciting white water rafting in Nepal. The name Kali Gandaki is given after the name of Goddess Kali (Considered as Divine Mother and at time can be destructive). Kali Gandaki river itself follows down to the plains from Annapurna and Dhaulagiri ranges, carving the one of the deepest canyons in the World.During the rafting course in Nepal, you will find cascading warm water waterfalls which are great for playing in. Kali Gandagi river rafting is on of the 'must do things' in Nepal, which gives you an awesome taste of white water thrills, Nepalâ€™s nature and culture at its best, as well as allowing you the chance to relax and get to know your rafting team around the evening fire on the pristine sandy white beaches that dot the Rivers banks.</p>
