<p style="text-align: justify;">Lobuche Peak Climbing which is situated close to Khumbu Glacier in Everest Region offers an attractive climb summit with a variety of existing routes and wide scope for new lines. Lobuche Peak is one of the popular trekking peaks in the Himalayan country of Nepal. Mt. Lobuche climb is definitely a bit more challenging than another popular climb to Island Peak. The peak is an attractive summit and offers several trails for climbing. This trip is combining with Everest base camp and Kalapatthar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lobuche peak has two summits, East and West with heights of 6119m and 6145m respectively. A continuous ridge connects them, but it is long and there is a considerable weight loss and gain. The East Peak is recognized as a trekking peak, whereas the West is known as an Expedition Peak. Lobuje being an attractive mountain offers various existing routes and also the potential for new ones. The dark triangle of the rocky east face rises over the moraines of the Khumbu Glacier to a spectacular skyline, forming the south ridge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lobuche East is reached by descending a marked notch and then climbing steep snowy slopes to the top. From the summit, we have a great view of Mt. Everest, Amadablam etc., and a 360 degree Himalayan panorama that include all important peaks in the Khumbu Valley. This Lobuje peak climbing is a beautiful climb with some technical challenges. Another most popular attraction of this region is Sagarmatha national park  which gives you opportunity to explore flora and fauna and meet rare wild animals like Red Panda, Himalayan thar, Musk deer, goral, snow leopard, Serow etc.</p>
