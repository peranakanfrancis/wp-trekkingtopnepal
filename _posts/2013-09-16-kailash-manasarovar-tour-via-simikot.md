<p style="text-align: justify;">Tucked away in the southwest corner of <a href="http://oshoadventure.com/destination/tibet/">Tibet </a>near <strong>Mount Kailash</strong>, <strong>Lake Manasarovar</strong> or <strong>Lake Manasa Sarovar</strong> also known as <strong>Mapam Yumco</strong> or <strong>Mapam Yutso</strong> (4560m) in Tibet which  is the highest freshwater lake in the world . The color of water is sapphire-blue waters and sandy shoreline and snow-capped-mountain backdrop make it most appealing, and a welcome change of venue from the often-forbidding terrain of Mt Kailash, Tibet’s holiest peak.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mt. Kailash is the scared site which holds the great value not only for the<strong> Hindu pilgrimage</strong> and <a href="http://oshoadventure.com/buddhist-pilgrimage-tour-package-nepal/">Buddhist pilgrimage</a> but also for the Bon and Jain. Mount Kailash is the sources of many Himalayan rivers among many the four greatest rivers of Asia such as-: <strong>the Ganges, Indus, Tsangpo</strong> and <strong>Sutlej</strong>. From ancient period Hindus people believe that  Mount Kailash as the  demonstration of their religious center of the universe, ‘<strong>world pillar</strong>’ around which all else rotate,  in the lowest misery and its peak kissing the heavens and on top there is home of God Shiva and Goddess Parvati.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The best time to make Mt. Kailash &amp; Lake Manasarovar tour is between mid-May and mid-October. During this time the weather in Mt. Kailash and Lake Manasarovar is generally stable and clear, with warm temperatures during the days and cool nights.</p>
