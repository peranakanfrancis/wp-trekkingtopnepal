<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Island Peak climbing</strong> is also known as the Imja Tse Peak which is also one of major attraction of Nepal for climbing. Island peak (6,189) is situated in Khumbu region above the Imja Tse khola, hence is it also called as Imja Tse peak. The peak is surrounded by the three glacier i.e. Imja, Lhotse and Lhotse Shar glaciers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Island peak climbing</strong> is not technically so hard but it offers a worthwhile challenge to the experienced winter mountaineer, competent in using ice axe and crampons, being technically straight forward, the most difficult section being a mixed rock and ice wall at a slope of around 45 degrees leading to the narrow summit ridge, approximately Scottish Winter Grade 2.</p>
