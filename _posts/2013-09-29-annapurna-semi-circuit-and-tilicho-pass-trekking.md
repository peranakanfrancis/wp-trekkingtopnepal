Dhaulagiri and Mt. <a href="http://www.oshoadventure.com/nepal/trekking/manaslu-trekking/">Manaslu</a> including arrays of over 6000m snow capped peaks.The trail follows the river Marsyangdi all the way to its source, the glacial lake in Manang, through the rural farm villages and terraced farm fields from the sub-tropic climate to the arctic landscape and through the rain forest to the alpine woodlands.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tilicho trail provides the world’s best trekking routes, including variety of scenery and culture than can be found in any other Himalayan region. This route via Tilicho Lake and the two high passes Masokanto La 5,099 m and Tilicho Pass 5,230 m is still used and offers the adventurous trekkers to altitude pass and with technical conditions like use of rope.Most of the tribal inhabitants are Thakalis, Gurung’s, Magars, and further north lives the Manang people of Tibetan origin.
