<p style="text-align: justify;">Sikkim and Goecha La trek is yet another beautiful trek which takes you unto Geocha-la (4,942 m), opposite the eastern face of Mt.Kanchenjunga (8,435 m) 3rd highest peak in the world and one of the most magnificent majestic peaks of the Himalayan range. Most of our trips in the eastern Himalaya and across the border, starts with a sweeping flight to the Gangetic plains of south east Nepal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From here a scenic drive to Sikkim with a visit at the Queen of the Hills in Darjeeling in the comfort of the Hotel, where it still retains the touch of heritage from the British Raj. From Darjeeling with a wonderful tour, a drive takes to Yuksom for our stunning adventure on the foothills of the great Mt. Kanchenjunga.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Sikkim and Goecha La trek begins through dense sub-tropical forests and passes vast pasture lands of grazing yaks and reaches the alpine region leaving the lush vegetation behind for few artic high Himalayan plants and shrubs. Once in the alpine region observing constant view of the great snow capped peaks nearly every day of the trek, after reaching our high destination at Goecha-la with the superb view of the Kanchenjunga, we retrace our fabulous journey back to Yuksom with a drive to KalimpongÂ another queen of the hill station, after a memorable trip we drive back to Nepal border for the panoramic flight to Kathmandu.</p>
