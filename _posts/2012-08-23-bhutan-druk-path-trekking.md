[mytab name='Useful Info']
<h3>Typical Day on Trek</h3>
After packing bags and hearty breakfast, we set out for a walk. We stop for a lunch after 3-4 hours walking. The afternoon walk is relatively short and therefore we arrive at our destination on time. Upon our arrival at destination, tea is served. We spend remaining afternoon in exploring the village, doing a bit of washing or by enjoying a guide book.. Sometimes we will be free after the lunch. You can enjoy your evening by playing cards and relieving the days tiredness before you to bed.
<h3>Luggage While Trekking</h3>
Your main luggage will be carried either by the porters or at the back of animals like Yak. You will have to carry just a day pack with water bottle, camera, sun-screen, spare jackets etc along with a small load that gives you the full enjoyment of the trek. A trek bag is ideal for your main luggage, plus a small lockable bag for travel clothes or anything that you do not need during trek which you can leave at hotel’s locker room/safe deposit box in Kathmandu for free of charge. Weight allowance at Nepal ’s domestic airlines is 15 Kgs, excess weight is chargeable at USD 1 or more per Kilo depending on sectors
<h3>Group Size</h3>
We have a small group of like minded people who always work for making your trip memorable and insightful, by creating an opportunity to interact with local people about their culture and life style. Our group generally consists of 12 members. We need a minimum of 2 participants to run our fixed departure dates. For private trips, no minimum and maximum apply. You are free to choose any type of trips at your convenient time frame for any numbers of people if you want to travel independently with friends, families and colleagues.
<h3>How we meet in Kathmandu</h3>
You need to forward your international flight details to us in advance for your greeting at the airport. As you complete the custom formalities and come out of the terminal building, you will be noticing our representative waiting to welcome you with holding garland and our company signpost. Please look at your Printed Name and Our Company Signboard Osho World Adventure Pvt. Ltd. and follow them. Meet our representative and then you will be transferred to hotel. You will be served free welcome drinks, tea or coffee or juice at the time of check in.
<h3>Rescue / Evacuations</h3>
In case of serious sickness or casualty, you will be transferred to the nearest hospital and you will be liable for all the expenses incurred in evacuation. Therefore, please make sure that it is covered by your insurance before assigning for it or be prepared to pay on your own after getting back to Kathmandu.
<h3>Responsible Travel &amp; Tourism</h3>
Wonderful environment of the Himalayas is also an extremely fragile one. Increasing population density and numbers of trekkers threaten the very beauty of Nepal and Bhutan . As deforestation is one of the greatest environmental threats, we do not have camp fires and use kerosene for cooking as an alternative fuel to wood.

We also discourage you to use wood-fuelled hot showers in lodges along the way. Many lodges, however, now provide solar hot showers, a far more eco-friendly alternative.

Garbage disposal is another major problem and some of the busier trails can, at times, appear strew with litter. Our staff members are well motivated towards eco-friendly practices. We carry out all our garbage, apart from that which can be safely and easily burnt at the campsite. Our aim is to help protect and preserve this beautiful environment for future generations of trekkers to enjoy.
<h3>Trip Extensions</h3>
We can help you to extend your trip if you are interested to trek more both within and other neighboring countries. You can try rafting or you may go for Jungle safari in Nepal or you can enjoy Nepal cultural tour. You can also go for trek in Tibet , India and Bhutan . After the trek ends in Pokhara, you are strongly advised to spend few more days in exploring sights and sounds of the this beautiful city.

All staffs and porters are equipped with adequate clothing and equipments.

<h3>What does grading (Easy, Moderate, Adventurous, Challenging) means?</h3>
"Grading" is a term used for rating treks based on difficulty. We have four grade of trekking in Bhutan i.e. Easy, Moderate, Adventurous and Challenging- the challenge in terms of both technicality and geography increases as we move higher in that order.
<blockquote><strong>Easy Treks</strong>

No previous trek experience and any physical preparation are required to attempt this trek. An interest in walking will be enough to take up such treks. Such treks usually vary from 2 days hike to 5 days trekking and can reach up to an altitude of 3000 m.

<strong>Moderate Treks</strong>

Moderate Treks need at least 6-7 hours of daily walking every day which crosses 4000 m above high altitude passes, and long and exhausting walks through often rough trails, rocks and boulders.

<strong>Adventurous Treks</strong>

Adventurous treks required previous trekking experience and technical knowledge. Besides this 6-7 hours walking through rough trails and crossing high passes as high as 5000 m.

<strong>Challenging Treks</strong>

These are long days trekking with long hours challenging walks passing through high altitude above 5000 m, difficult terrains and glacier and snow walking. No doubt you need to be mentally and physically fit and in excellent health condition.</blockquote>
<h3>What is altitude sickness?</h3>
Altitude sickness is also known as Acute Mountain Sickness which generally occurs when people ascend too quickly in altitudes of over 3000 m. Altitude sickness is the major problem when you are trekking. And it is really necessary for you to study the causes, symptoms and treatment of the attitude sickness before trekking and climbing. Average of three peoples per year dies due to the Altitude sickness.

While trekking and climbing it is necessary adjust your schedule for trekking in above 3.000 meters. It is better if you climb no more than 400 meters per day when you are climbing above 3000 meters. If you fail to allow time for adaptation, you may develop the symptoms of Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS). You can easily care it with a day’s rest or if ignored can lead to death. So before trekking, especially in higher altitude, basic awareness of AMS is necessary for safe trek.
<h3>What happens if there’s an emergency?</h3>
Generally, you are not likely to face any emergency but if the situation goes serious, then you can send word to the nearby village with radio service for a helicopter evacuation. It can cost you up to $1500-$2500 (even more depending upon the situation) for a helicopter evacuation and it requires a guarantee of payment before the helicopter takes off. If you register with your embassy, then this process can be done in great speed. However, if the case is not so serious, then you can find some health posts or air field for check-up. So, we recommend you to have necessary travel insurance which can cover all those expenses.
<h3>Is there an emergency contact number?</h3>
Yes. You can dial on <strong>9751000991</strong> anytime from anywhere. If you are using international number you need to put our country code 00977 or if you are dialing from local number in Kathmandu, doesn’t need to put any code.
<h3>Do I need to tip my guide and porters? How much would that be?</h3>
This is very difficult thing to determine. We have seen everything from 10USD to 500 USD per person for guides and porters. Tipping is not required, but a small way to show your guides and local porters thanks for their help. The level of the tip should reflect the level of personal involvement with your guide.
<h3>How can I book my trip in advance?</h3>
If you are traveling in high tourist season i.e. between October to November and March to April, you have to book the tour six to ten months before. Because of the limitation of the infrastructure in tourism industry, you are asked to book the trip in advance.
<h3>What is the mode of payment?</h3>
We accept major credit cards such as VISA, Master and American Express. You can use any of above credit card to pay us. You can also pay us either by Western Union Money Transfer or PayPal or Direct Bank Transfer.
