<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kanchenjunga South</strong> – <strong>North Base Camp Trekking </strong>bring lots of fun, adventure in your life as the region is very pristine in Natural beauty. We trek to both base camp of the world’s third highest peak, <strong>Mt. Kanchenjunga</strong>. Trekkers can experience the spectacular and panoramic view of Himalayas such as Everest, Lhotse, Makalu and Kanchenjunga. Moreover, trekkers can also see the some animals such as <strong>Musk deer, blue sheep, Himalayan Thar</strong> and many others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mt. Kanchenjunga is honored with the “<strong>Five treasures of snow</strong>” and the journey in this region is very special due to the tropical lowlands to the great <strong>rhododendron forests, lovely villages</strong> and <strong>glaciers</strong>. <strong>Kanchenjunga Conservation Area</strong> covered an area of 2,035 sq. kilometers enriched in wildlife such as <strong>snow leopard, Himalayan black bear, musk dear </strong>and<strong> red panda.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kanchenjunga South and North Base Camp Trekking starts from <strong>Suketar, Taplejung</strong> which can be accessible by air. We can also start our trek from Basanatapur, Kanchenjunga which passes through the rhododendron forest into high alpine terrain beyond the Gunsa village followed by Lapsung La pass, Selele pass, Yalung glacier and ultimately to theKanchenjunga base camp.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This region is government restricted region so special trekking permit is required to trek in this area which can be obtained from the government registered trekking agencies from in Nepal. Osho World Adventure, registered under the Government Registration Act has organized number of trekking to this region. Trekking in Kanchenjunga region is much different that trekking in Annapurna and Everest region. Hence, trekkers having an aim to explore new things and enjoying wilderness in life can join this trekking.</p>
