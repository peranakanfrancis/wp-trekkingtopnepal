<span style="color: #333333;"><em>According to legends, Holi is </em><em>observed to rejoice the extermination of female demon Holika, the sister of the Demon King Hiranya kashyapu who conispered to burnt his own son Pralhad,a devout follower of Lord Vishnu. It is believed that Hiranya Kashyapu ordered Holika to enter into fire along with Pralhad on her lap so that Pralhad would stop chanting the name of Lord Vishnu. Holika had received a boon from Gods that she would not burn. But it so happened that the fire burnt Holika and Pralhad remained unharmed, still chanting the Lords Vishnu’s name. That day the whole nation celebrated the cremation of the demons sister with colors and since then Holi is celebrated.</em></span>
