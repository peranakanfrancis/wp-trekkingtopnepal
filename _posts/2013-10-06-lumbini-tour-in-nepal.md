<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lumbini</strong> is derived from sanskrit and means ‘Lovely’. Lumbini is the birth place of Lord Budhha and today a world renowned Buddhist site. It is located at the Nepalese town of Kapilavastu in Rupandehi District, near the Indian border. Lumbini is one of four Buddhist pilgrimage sites based on major events in the life of Gautama Buddha. The other three sites are in India: Bodh Gaya (enlightenment), Sarnath (first discourse), and Kushinagar (death).</p>
