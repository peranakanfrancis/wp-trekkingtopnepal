<p style="text-align: justify;">Upper Dolpo via Dho trekking is another adventurous trekking available in Dolpo region. Upper Dolpo via Dho trekking gives an experience of remoteness and wilderness to the trekkers. The trail is quite different than the classical upper Dolpo trekking including the passes Kangla and Gela. Due to the close link to the Tibet, the culture and life style of people living in this region are similar to Tibetan people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Trekker can experience how the people spend their whole day and how they live with this trekking. Due to the lack of link to the urban area, trekking in this region can be very funny and adventurous. The most notable wild life of this region is Blue Sheep, Snow Leopard and Ghoral which is listed in endangered species.</p>
