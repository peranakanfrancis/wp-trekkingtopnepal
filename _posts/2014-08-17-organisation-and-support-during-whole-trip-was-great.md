<p style="text-align: justify;">Many thanks for arranging a wonderful trip round Annapurna to Deepak and Osho World Adventure team. We were for the first time in Nepal and enjoyed trekking (thanks to Deepak) very much. Organisation and support during the whole trip was great. We will recommend Osho World Adventure to all our friends and people interested in travelling to Nepal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">P.S. special thanks to Arjun (hope you will join us as a guide during our next visit to Nepal)</p>
