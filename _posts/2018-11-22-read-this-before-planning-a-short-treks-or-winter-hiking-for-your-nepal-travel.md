Winter hiking in Nepal could be too freezing in the higher altitude of mountains so we recommend to explore the lower altitude of the hiking trails for your winter trekking in Nepal. There are some lovely villages and gompas (monasteries), and the friendly Sherpa people of the Solu Khumbu region make trekking through the area a joy.

This Annapurna region is inhabited by the Gurungs and Magars community: agriculturists of Tibetan origin, the Magars are skilled craftsmen in stone and wood. You will receive a warm welcome to their tea houses and shops. Be warned: this trek will not satisfy you – you will want to return for longer treks in this or other regions!

The scenery on this <a href="http://52.70.50.211/trip/ghorepani-ghandruk-short-annapurna-trek/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghorepani Ghandruk Short Annapurna Trek,</a> changes from lowland terraced fields to magnificent forests of pine, oak and rhododendron. This Poon Hill Trek can be tackled throughout the year. Mountain views improve as you climb higher and the early morning sunrise from Poon Hill is breathtaking. This is one of the Annapurna region short treks that is suitable for almost anyone, including children and with reasonable fitness level. The highest point in Poon Hill is just over 3,210m/10,530ft and so there is no chance of being affected by altitude sickness.
