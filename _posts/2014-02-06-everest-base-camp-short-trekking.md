<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Everest Base Camp Short Trekking</strong> probably offers one of the world class trekking experiences in Everest region. Not every one will have time to do the extended trekking Everest, so seeing the glimpse of Mt. Everest, world’s tallest peak, remains a dream. It is for those trekkers who have limited time but wants to see Everest that this program has been designed.
