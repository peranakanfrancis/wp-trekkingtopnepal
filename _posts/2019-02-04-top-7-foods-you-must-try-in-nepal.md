<p> Ask any Nepali what their favorite food is and youâ€™re likely to get a laugh and a â€˜<em>dal bhat, of course!</em>â€™ While itâ€™s imperative that you get used to eating dal and rice several times a week (if not, twice a day), there are plenty of other delicious traditional Nepali dishes that you should try while in Nepal. Here are our favorites. </p>

<h2>8. Sel Roti</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1741,"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://52.70.50.211/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/sel-roti-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1741"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes called Nepalâ€™s answer to the donut (because theyâ€™re deep-fried and round), sel roti are in fact much less sweet than the familiar donut, though they do have a hint of sweetness. Theyâ€™re commonly found at road-side snack stalls and made in Nepali homes during celebrations and certain festivals (especially Maghe Sankranti and Tihar).</p>

<h2>7. Chiura</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1742,"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://52.70.50.211/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/chiura-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1742"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chiura is a bit of an acquired taste. It is rice that has been beaten flat and dried to keep it fresher for longer. It can be quite dry to eat, so itâ€™s best as an accompaniment to very wet curries. Be warned that it swells up in the belly once eaten, so you can feel quite full after eating chiura!</p>

<h2>6. Jeri</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1743,"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://52.70.50.211/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Jalebis-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1743"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jeri also known as&nbsp;<em>jalebi</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>jilphi</em>, are one of the most common sweets in Nepal. &nbsp;They are deep-fried, pretzel-shaped yellow-orange loops dipped in saffron syrup. &nbsp;<em>Jeri&nbsp;</em>tastes best when freshly made as they are crisp and the filling is succulent and aromatic.&nbsp;If you keep it overnight, jeri looses their crispiness, and the filling crystallizes, but they are still delicious. &nbsp;Traditionally,<em>&nbsp;jeri</em> are paired with soft Nepali bread called <em>swaari</em> or <em>poori</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>5. Juju dhau</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1752,"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://52.70.50.211/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/jujudhau-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1752"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Juju dhau, or â€˜king curdâ€™, is a thick, creamy, sweetened yogurt served in clay pots in the city of&nbsp;Bhaktapur. Itâ€™s made with buffalo milk, so itâ€™s much richer than regular cowâ€™s milk yogurt. Itâ€™s an important accompaniment to many Newari celebrations and a must-try when visiting Bhaktapur. Grab a pot from a street-side vendor.<br></p>

<h2>4. MoMo</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1744,"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://52.70.50.211/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/momo-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1744"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While momos are usually called Tibetan dumplings, the truth is, theyâ€™re usually better in Nepal (take this from someone whoâ€™s tried them in both places!). They are a favorite among Nepalis, not only of Tibetan origin, so itâ€™s safe to call them Nepali food. Rice paper wrappers are stuffed with finely chopped vegetables, minced buffalo or chicken and are steamed, deep fried or added to a spicy soup. Theyâ€™re also served with large helpings of spicy pickles, for dunking. You can choose to have your momo deep fried or sautÃ© with hot sauce. Momos are always hand-made fresh to order, so donâ€™t be surprised if your order takes three times longer than everyone elseâ€™s to arrive.</p>

<h2>3. Chatamari</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1745,"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://52.70.50.211/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/chatamari-1024x684.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1745"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chatamari is another favourite Newari snack that is very popular in Kathmandu. It has been called a â€˜Nepali pizzaâ€™, but thatâ€™s only because itâ€™s sort of round. Chatamari is a rice-flour crepe (thinner than bara) that is cooked with a variety of savoury toppings such as chopped onions, fresh coriander, minced meat, egg, chillis and a variety of spices.</p>

<h2>2. Yomari</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1746,"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://52.70.50.211/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Yomari-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1746"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yomari is such a special food that it has its own festival, usually celebrated in December, called&nbsp;Yomari Punhi. The Newari festival marks the end of the rice harvest and sweet yomari are made and eaten on this day. The pointed, fish-shaped dumplings are made from rice flour and stuffed either with a sweet molasses mixture or a coconut one. Either is delicious.</p>

<h2>1. Dal bhat</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1747,"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://52.70.50.211/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dal-bhat-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1747"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alright, we couldnâ€™t present a list of traditional Nepali dishes without giving dal bhat an entry of its own! To call this rice and lentil dish a staple of Nepali cuisine would be an understatement â€“ itâ€™s so much more than&nbsp;<em>just&nbsp;</em>rice and lentils. When served in a restaurant or at home, the rice and lentil curry is accompanied by a variety of seasonable vegetable and meat curries (spinach, potato, mushroom, chicken, buffalo, etc), as well as a salad, pickles, papad and curd. Itâ€™s not just a dish, itâ€™s a full meal and a tasty and satisfying one at that. Itâ€™s no wonder Nepalis are obsessed.</p>
