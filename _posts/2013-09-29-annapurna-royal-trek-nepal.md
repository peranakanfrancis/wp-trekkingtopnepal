<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Annapurna Royal Trek Nepal</strong> is an ideal holiday trekking trip in Annapurna Region for the first time or beginner trekkers and travelers to experience the endless beauty of Himalayan country Nepal. <strong>Syaglung trekking</strong> offers you a walk to moderate mountain ranges at the elevation of 1400m with superb view of Dhaulagiri, Manaslu, Annapurna,  and Lamjung Himal. Syaglung Trekking is well known for Royal Trekking after the Prince Charles of Wales walked through on his holiday, highly recommended for those who want to try trekking but are unsure about the physical demands.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The route is very easy, simple and passes through the low altitude, the climate is warmer and you will have the opportunity to stroll through the rice terraced fields.  This lower hill short circuit can be worked into any travel itinerary which offers great views of the close snow capped mountain range. Explore the villages of the middle hills, Hindus, Gurung's the mid hill tribes.</p>
