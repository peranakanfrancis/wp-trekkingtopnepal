<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Nepal is bouncing back from earthquakes and a fuel strike that made getting round the country tough. It remains a fabulous choice for budget-conscious travellers, who can access the best of its world-famous trekking routes and underrated wildlife for well south of US$50 a day. Visitor numbers are slowly recovering and the time is ripe to get back to Nepal’s mighty mountains; wherever you go, you’ll receive a warm welcome, as your visit brings much-needed income to communities getting back on their feet.</p><cite>- No.1 in "<em><a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/travel-tips-and-articles/best-in-travel-2017-top-10-best-value-destinations/40625c8c-8a11-5710-a052-1479d276856d">Best Value Destination to Travel</a>"</em> by  LonelyPlanet 2017.</cite></blockquote>
