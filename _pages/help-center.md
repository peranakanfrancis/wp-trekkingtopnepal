<h3>Facts of Nepal</h3>
<div class="faq-wrapper">
	<dl class="faqs">
		<dt><strong>Q</strong>: How do Nepalese greets each other?</dt>
		<dd>"Namaste" is the magic word! To do this the Nepalese way, you can join your palms and bow down head a little when you greet.</dd>
		
		<dt><strong>Q</strong>: I heard Sunday is not a holiday in Nepal?</dt>
		<dd>You're correct, different from the world, in Nepal we have six working days and have Saturday’s as days off.</dd>
		
		<dt><strong>Q</strong>: What to wear in Nepal?</dt>
		<dd>There are different array of climate in Nepal and make sure to look at the weather update before packing your bags. There are no such things as “not wearable clothes”, be sure you are culturally sensitive when you are in the rurals. Tight fitting, figure-hugging clothing such as those made with Lycra can often be offensive to locals, especially to women. If you find these items comfortable as a base layer, please pack something to wear on top of them. 

If you forget to pack some essential stuff there is no need to panic you can buy almost everything you require in Nepal.</dd>
		
		<dt><strong>Q</strong>: Is Electricity supply covered everywhere in Nepal?</dt>
		<dd>Nepal has hours of power outage in fall and winter whereas just couple of hours only in the monsoon. The power outage can go up to 14-16 hours in a day in winter and fall. Residential outlet power used in Nepal is 220-240 volts unlike to that of USA and other countries which use 110-120 volts. Plugging in any appliances in Nepal which requires only 110-120v may result in demolishing the device completely and in some case causing harm to you as well.</dd>

		<dt><strong>Q</strong>: How to stay healthy in Nepal?</dt>
		<dd>Although you may practice eating salads in your country it is suggested to eat thoroughly cooked food while in Nepal. The other prime factor to be careful about while in Nepal is water, either drink a good branded bottled water i.e. Himalayas on top, Baily or Bisleri, or drink water which is boiled and cooled off. Make sure you bring or buy a proper mask.</dd>
		<dt><strong>Q</strong>: Can I bring any medications with me?</dt>
