<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Nepal should be on everyone’s bucket list. It is by no means pure adventure, but it is something that will stay with you for life. In a weird sort of a way it felt like a pilgrimage; standing small amongst ‘gods’ and worshipping what a wonderful world we live in. Somehow everything else seems to pale into insignificance when looking at it like that.</em></p><cite>- by Ed Farelly</cite></blockquote>
