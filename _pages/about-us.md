<p>Osho Adventure is uniquely different in the marketplace in that our tours specialize not only in nature’s beauty but also show you your own Buddha nature through meditation.  Alongside Nepal’s many natural wonders, we offer a wide variety of ancient and modern yoga and meditation programs. We design meaningful experiences that combine radical adventure and deep meditation for a life-enhancing peak experience, not just another vacation.</p>
