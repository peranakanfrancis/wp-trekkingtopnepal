<h3>What is Responsible Tourism?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Responsible Tourism in Nepal is a sustainable management of tourism which is aimed to ensuring economic, social and environmental benefits and minimizing costs to destinations. Simply Responsible Tourism is tourism “which creates better places for people to live in, and better places to visit”. The approach aims to achieve the triple-bottom line outcomes of sustainable development which includes economic growth, environmental integrity and social justice.</p>
