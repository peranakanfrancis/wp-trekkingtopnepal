&lt;h4&gt;Porter-supported trek&lt;/h4&gt;
Two clients share one porter. We will supply you a trek duffel bag where you keep your heavy items and this bag is carried by the porter. You will need to bring your own daypack to be carried by you. In the daypack, you can put money, important documents, water bottle/bladder, camera, toiletries, sunscreen, notebook, etc.

&lt;strong&gt;Baggage weight limitation&lt;/strong&gt;

The weight limit for Kathmandu-Lukla-Kathmandu flights is 15 kg or 33 pounds. This is combining both the duffel bag and the daypack. If you exceed this limit, you will have to pay an additional fee. When this happens, sometimes the airline sends your bag in later flights and this can be very problematic for many reasons. So, we recommend you to pack as carefully as you can and not exceed the weight limit. You can leave your non-trekking stuff at the locker facility in the Kathmandu hotel.

Along the trekking routes, teahouses/lodges generally provide basic clean facilities with a mattress and a quilt or blanket. We can also offer you Ace the Himalaya sleeping bags if needed (to be returned after the trip) but it is a good idea to always have your own sleeping equipment. The lodges in trekking routes usually provide single and double rooms, or occasionally a dormitory. At times when possible, dining will be around a bonfire. In teahouses, food will be prepared in the kitchen, which you should not enter without permission."";i:2;s:267:""Most of the tea houses do have western style flushing toilet however in higher elevation you could find the squat toilets made of either a ceramic basin on the ground or few planks precariously positioned over a hole in the ground which is always outside of the room."";i:3;s:180:""At most cases you can use the toilet provided by the tea houses/lodges on the trail but normally in case of emergency, you just do toilet along the trail wherever you find privacy."";i:4;s:126:""All the guest houses sell the toilet paper so you can buy it there itself. Hand sanitizer and a towel you must bring your own."";i:5;s:243:""During the trek we will try our best but normally the lodges have twin sharing and dormitory styled room instead of a single room. The lodges will provide a private room for one person when the room is free and additional cost is not required."";i:6;s:942:""Most teahouses (lodges) in Everest region trails cook a delicious range of mostly vegetarian fare. Pasta, tuna bakes, noodles, potatoes, eggs, daal bhat(rice and lentils), bread, soup, fresh vegetables (variety depends on the season) and even some desserts like apple pies, pancakes, and some interesting attempts at custard. You will find a lot of garlic on the menu because it assists with acclimatization – eat some every day. In many larger villages you may find some meat items on the menu. You can always get hot chocolate, tea, and hot lemon drinks, as well as soft drinks, and treats like chocolate and crisps.

For Muslim trekker, the mountain villagers don't raise pig so it will be no food here that contains pig. However, as most of the nepali are Hindu so they don't have the practise of Halal slaughtering, if you mustn't the alternative choice will be opting vegetarian foods. In fact, most of the villagers are vegetarian."";i:7;s:259:""No problem at all because mostly, the lodges serve the vegetarian meals. We always recommend our clients to eat vegetarian meals to avoid the food poisoning, eating heavy meals and non- vegetarian meals at the high altitude is not really safe for the stomach."";i:8;s:503:""Although it's normally safe to drink the mountain water during the trek but you can also buy bottled water at the cost of US $2 at lower elevations to US $4 to higher elevation per little. More higher you go it would be expensive. Bottled water is easily available at the lodges and teahouses. 

If you have allergy and planning to drink normal water, purifying water with any sort of purification tablets or drop is must. You can purchase purification tablets or iodine in Kathmandu, Lukla or Namche."";i:9;s:336:""At the lower altitude like Lukla, Phakding, Namche the guesthouses provide the facilities of hot shower. And in rest of the places (at higher elevation), warm water in the bucket will be provided for shower.

 	&lt;li&gt;This tour takes you to the highest point in the legend Trans-Himalayan Region in Tibet.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Magnificent Mount Kailash Peak is believed to be the centre of the universe.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Homely environment&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Witness beautiful Mansarovar lake, as you move around its freshwater changes from deep blue color to green.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&amp;nbsp;"";s:10:""5_wpeditor"";s:8977:""All you need to bring for this Tour is simply some comfortable clothes; there is no any requirement of special equipment on the tour. Personal belongings of the clients which is required at any moment like money, water bottle, camera, suns cream and toilet paper etc. should be carried by yourself. It is therefore advisable that you pack the personal belongings into your daypack.
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;General&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;4 seasons Sleeping bag (Optional/we can provide one if you need it but is to be returned after the trek)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Duffel or Rucksack bag or suitcase (We will provide one complimentary ACE duffel bag for you to keep.)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Daypack&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Down Jacket (Optional/we can provide if you need one but is to be returned after the trek)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Upper Body - Head / Ears / Eyes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Shade hat or baseball cap – some people drape a bandana down the back of their head and then put a baseball cap on to hold it is place. This can be a flexible alternative while keeping the sun off your ears and neck.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Warm wool or synthetic hat that cover your ears.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Balaclava – lightweight, thinner variety.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Glacier glasses-100% UV protection with side shields and a hard-sided storage case (i.e. Julbo or Cebe). This is to protect your eyes from the stronger rays of the sun due to the thinner atmosphere which can cause a painful condition known as snow blindness. Regular sunglasses are not sufficient. If you wear prescription glasses, speak to your doctor about prescription glacier glasses, perhaps with transitional lenses.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Headlamp – Black Diamond and Petzl both make several good ones. Make sure to bring extra batteries and that they are lithium batteries so that they will last in the colder temperatures. These are indispensable for getting around at night, reading, etc. so, don’t go cheap here.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Some people like ear-muffs; These are optional; a good hat, balaclava, and hooded jacket should really be sufficient, but this is a personal choice for some people (optional).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;A neck warmer is another piece of gear for extra warmth if you feel you will need it (optional).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Hand&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair liner gloves, thin wool or synthetic, useful alone on mild days or as a layer inside another gloves / mitts for additional warmth.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair warm gloves (heavier fleece or wool).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair shell gloves or mitts; Gore-Tex is preferred for keeping hands dry.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Instant hand warmers are always nice in a pinch, but really shouldn’t be necessary on the trek. Bringing appropriate hand protection as recommended above, should be sufficient (optional).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Core Body&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;T-shirts (2).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Light and expedition weight thermal tops.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Fleece jacket or pullover.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Fleece Wind-Stopper jacket (optional).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Waterproof (preferably breathable fabric) shell jacket.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 women sports bras, Synthetic, no cotton (for lady only)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Lower Body – Legs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 pairs nylon hiking shorts – Quick drying type, not cotton!&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Underwear, stay away from cotton (4).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 pairs lightweight long underwear – capilene or other synthetic.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair soft shell pants – synthetic, full zip from top and bottom preferable.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 pairs trekking pants, preferably that zip on/off at the knees so they double as shorts.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair hard shell pants. Waterproof / breathable, Gore-Tex or equivalent is best. Should zip from the top and bottom – this makes it easier to put on over boots without getting undressed should the weather change once you are underway for the day.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair cotton pants (loose jeans/khakis).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt; All clothing should be kept dry using waterproof stuff sacks or large puncture resistant plastic bags.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Feet&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt; 4 pairs of liner socks, synthetic or capilene.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;3 pairs heavy weight socks to be worn over liner socks.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair light weight socks, a good option for the lower / warmer parts of the trail.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair light to medium weight waterproof hiking/trekking boots. Ensure a good fit with layered socks and you have worn then before to get used to it (otherwise you will get lots of blister).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair light trekking shoes or sneakers. Good for around the camp/lodges and in Kathmandu.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair hiking gaiters, good for keeping dust and rocks out of your shoes / boots as well as keep your feet dry as necessary (Optional).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair sandals (Optional).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Medicines and First Aid Kits&lt;/h4&gt;
(Please note our guide will also carry the first aid kit bag during the tour. However we still recommend you to bring your personal first aid kit as well)
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Extra Strength Excedrin for altitude related headaches.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Ibuprofen for general aches and pains.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Immodium or Pepto bismol capsules for upset stomach or diarrhea.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Diamox (commonly prescribed as Acetazolamide) 125 or 250mg tablets for altitude sickness. Please discuss with us before starting to take this medicine.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 small personal sized first-aid kit with blister treatments such as mole skin, band-aids, some waterproof tape, anti-infection ointments, etc. Your guides will have more extensive medical gear, but you should have the basics for general use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

 	&lt;li&gt;Durable wallet / pouch for travel documents, money &amp;amp; passport.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Lip balm. At least SPF 20, 2 sticks. A string taped to the stick is helpful, to hang around your neck and some are now being sold with a cord already attached. Handy as it avoids you from having to stop and look for it.&lt;/li&gt;

356,"Everest Base Camp via Kalapathar Trek","Everest Base Camp via Kalapathar trek (EBC) is one of the most popular adventurous <strong>trekking trails in Everest</strong> or Khumbu region. The trekking takes you to Kalapathar (5545m) the single most important vantage point to watch Everest in its entirety.

EBC trek has been listed as <em>World’s Top Ten Treks</em> by National Geographic and <em>Top 50 Places To Visit Before You Die </em>BBC.

Since this is at one of the highest altitude regions, the trek is of fairly strenuous grade and very demanding. However, you are bound to be rewarded with stunning views to be seen from nowhere which is absolutely worth it.

Two clients share one porter. We will supply you with a trek duffel bag where you keep your heavy items and this bag is carried by the porter. You will need to bring your own daypack to be carried by you. In the daypack, you can put money, important documents, water bottle/bladder, camera, toiletries, sunscreen, notebook, etc.

&lt;strong&gt;Baggage Weight&lt;/strong&gt;

The weight limit for Kathmandu-Lukla-Kathmandu flights is 15 kg or 33 pounds. This is combining both the duffel bag and the daypack. If you exceed this limit, you will have to pay an additional fee. When this happens, sometimes the airline sends your bag in later flights and this can be very problematic for many reasons. You can leave your non-trekking stuff at the locker facility in the Kathmandu hotel.

A short descent to the Jorsaleand Village and the trail levels for some time. We are now heading towards Namche Bazaar- the walk along the riverbed is pleasant before winding uphill path, with the magnificent view of Kwangde peak, Kusum kangru Mt.Everest- Nuptse wall, Lhotse, and Taweche peak in the background.

401,"Mera Peak Climbing & Expedition","Mera Peak(6654m) is the highest permitted trekking peak of Nepal. It lies to the south of the Mt.Everest and dominates the watershed between the heavily wooded valleys of the Hinku and Hongu Drangkas.

This is a high-altitude trek and climb. It claims to be <em>the most difficult climbing peak as</em> trekker need to be physically fit. And this climbing also demands its climbers conversant with the use of ice-ax and crampons. So reaching the elevation of this peak is quite dangerous. Therefore, you need to be ready to face that difficulty having the preparation of necessary equipment.

Anyone who plan to trek in Everest region can go with Mera peak climbing which has non technical route to reach summit. From the summit (6476 m), you will see the panoramic views of Eight Thousanders including the world highest peak, Mt. Everest.

This climbing offers the most challenging and thrilling experience and the person climbing the peak feels this place as a paradise of the Earth. Mera Peak climbing takes the North face glacier with steady rise to summit ridge leading up to the top. After we reach to the Summit, we climb back through the direct route across a dramatic ridge to Lukla and the flight to Kathmandu."";s:10:""5_wpeditor"";s:7030:""&lt;h4&gt;Porter-supported trip&lt;/h4&gt;
Two clients share one porter. We will supply you a trek duffel bag where you keep your heavy items and this bag is carried by the porter. You will need to bring your own daypack to be carried by you. In the daypack, you can put money, important documents, water bottle/bladder, camera, toiletries, sunscreen, notebook, etc. And, as for the camping equipment, tents, kitchen accessories and group climbing equipment (i.e. climbing rope, ice screw, snow bar, and ice hammer) are provided by the company.
&lt;h4&gt;In-flight Baggage Weight&lt;/h4&gt;
The weight limit for Kathmandu-Lukla-Kathmandu flights is 15 kg or 33 pounds. This is combining both the duffel bag and the daypack. If you exceed this limit, you will have to pay an additional fee. When this happens, sometimes the airline sends your bag in later flights and this can be very problematic for many reasons. So, we recommend you to pack as carefully as you can and not exceed the weight limit. You can leave your non-trekking and non-climbing stuff at the locker facility in the Kathmandu hotel.
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Climbing Gear&lt;/h4&gt;

424,"Climbing & Expedition to Island Peak Nepal","Island Peak Nepal(6189m) is commonly called Imja Tse Peak.  It is situated in the Khumbu region above Imja Tse Khola.  The peak is surrounded by the three glaciers i.e. Imja, Lhotse and Lhotse Shar glaciers.

Island Peak is not technically so hard but it offers a worthwhile challenge to the experienced winter mountaineer. The peak demands its summitters to be competent in using ice axe and crampons. As Island Peak is technically straightforward, the most difficult section is a mixed rock and ice wall at a slope of around 45 degrees leading to the narrow summit ridge.

&amp;nbsp;"";s:10:""5_wpeditor"";s:9312:""&lt;h4&gt;Porter-supported trek&lt;/h4&gt;
Two clients share one porter. We will supply you with a trek duffel bag where you keep your heavy items and this bag is carried by the porter. You will need to bring your own daypack to be carried by you. In the daypack, you can put money, important documents, water bottle/bladder, camera, toiletries, sunscreen, notebook, etc.
&lt;h4&gt;Baggage Weight Limitation&lt;/h4&gt;
The weight limit for Kathmandu-Lukla-Kathmandu flights is 15 kg or 33 pounds. This is combining both the duffel bag and the daypack. If you exceed this limit, you will have to pay an additional fee. When this happens, sometimes the airline sends your bag in later flights and this can be very problematic for many reasons. You can leave your non-trekking stuff at the locker facility in the Kathmandu hotel.
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Climbing gear&lt;/h4&gt;
The Climbing equipments are more expensive to buy. So, please let us know if you want to rent the equipments at the additional cost of USD 250 per person. The Following equipments are essential for climbing Island peak.
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair plastic shell mountaineering boots with high altitude liners&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair of crampons (steel, no aluminum).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 Alpine climbing harness.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 Mountaineering an axe with leash (sized properly for your height)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 Ascender (right or left handed as appropriate)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 Belay device (Black Diamond ATC or ATC Guide are good options)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 D-Shaped locking carabiners&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 Non-locking carabiners&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 Pair expedition style gaiters (ensure fit over your boots)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Neck gaiter&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Ski goggles (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Climbing helmet (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;General&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;4 seasons Sleeping bag (Optional/we can provide one if you need it but is to be returned after the trek)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Duffel or Rucksack bag or suitcase (We will provide one complimentary ACE duffel bag for you to keep.)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Daypack&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Down Jacket (Optional/we can provide if you need one but is to be returned after the trek)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Upper Body - Head / Ears / Eyes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Shade hat or baseball cap – some people drape a bandana down the back of their head and then put a baseball cap on to hold it is place. This can be a flexible alternative while keeping the sun off your ears and neck.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Warm wool or synthetic hat that cover your ears.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Balaclava – lightweight, thinner variety.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Glacier glasses-100% UV protection with side shields and a hard-sided storage case (i.e. Julbo or Cebe). This is to protect your eyes from the stronger rays of the sun due to the thinner atmosphere which can cause a painful condition known as snow blindness. Regular sunglasses are not sufficient. If you wear prescription glasses, speak to your doctor about prescription glacier glasses, perhaps with transitional lenses.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Headlamp – Black Diamond and Petzl both make several good ones. Make sure to bring extra batteries and that they are lithium batteries so that they will last in the colder temperatures. These are indispensable for getting around at night, reading, etc. so, don’t go cheap here.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Some people like ear-muffs; These are optional; a good hat, balaclava, and hooded jacket should really be sufficient, but this is a personal choice for some people (optional).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;A neck warmer is another piece of gear for extra warmth if you feel you will need it (optional).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Hand&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair liner gloves, thin wool or synthetic, useful alone on mild days or as a layer inside other gloves/mitts for additional warmth.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair warm gloves (heavier fleece or wool).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair shell gloves or mitts; Gore-Tex is preferred for keeping hands dry.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Instant hand warmers are always nice in a pinch, but really shouldn’t be necessary on the trek. Bringing appropriate hand protection as recommended above, should be sufficient (optional).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Core Body&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;T-shirts (2).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Light and expedition weight thermal tops.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Fleece jacket or pullover.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Fleece Wind-Stopper jacket (optional).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Waterproof (preferably breathable fabric) shell jacket.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 women sports bras, Synthetic, no cotton!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Lower Body – Legs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 pairs nylon hiking shorts – Quick drying type, not cotton!&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Underwear, stay away from cotton (4).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 pairs lightweight long underwear – Capilene or other synthetic.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair soft shell pants – synthetic, full zip from top and bottom preferable.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 pairs trekking pants, preferably that zip on/off at the knees so they double as shorts.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair hard shell pants. Waterproof / breathable, Gore-Tex or equivalent is best. Should zip from the top and bottom – this makes it easier to put on over boots without getting undressed should the weather change once you are underway for the day.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair cotton pants (loose jeans/khakis).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt; All clothing should be kept dry using waterproof stuff sacks or large puncture resistant plastic bags.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Feet&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt; 4 pairs of liner socks, synthetic or Capilene.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;3 pairs heavy weight socks to be worn over liner socks.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair light weight socks, a good option for the lower / warmer parts of the trail.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair light to medium weight waterproof hiking/trekking boots. Ensure a good fit with layered socks and you have worn them before to get used to it (otherwise you will get lots of blister).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair light trekking shoes or sneakers. Good for around the camp/lodges and in Kathmandu.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair hiking gaiters, good for keeping dust and rocks out of your shoes/boots as well as keep your feet dry as necessary (Optional).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair sandals (Optional).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Medicines and First Aid Kits&lt;/h4&gt;
(Please note our guide will also carry the first aid kit bag during the trek. However, we still recommend you to bring your personal first aid kit as well)
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Extra Strength Excedrin for altitude related headaches.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Ibuprofen for general aches and pains.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Immodium or Pepto Bismol capsules for upset stomach or diarrhea.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Diamox (commonly prescribed as Acetazolamide) 125 or 250mg tablets for altitude sickness. Please discuss with us before starting to take this medicine.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 small personal sized first-aid kit with blister treatments such as mole skin, band-aids, some waterproof tape, anti-infection ointments, etc. Your guides will have more extensive medical gear, but you should have the basics for general use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Shade hat or baseball cap – some people drape a bandana down the back of their head and then put a baseball cap on to hold it. This can be a flexible alternative while keeping the sun off your ears and neck.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Warm wool or synthetic hat that cover your ears.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Balaclava – lightweight, thinner variety.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Glacier glasses-100% UV protection with side shields and a hard-sided storage case (i.e. Julbo or Cebe). This is to protect your eyes from the stronger rays of the sun due to the thinner atmosphere which can cause a painful condition known as snow blindness. Regular sunglasses are not sufficient. If you wear prescription glasses, speak to your doctor about prescription glacier glasses, perhaps with transitional lenses.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Headlamp – Black Diamond and Petzl both make several good ones. Make sure to bring extra batteries and that they are lithium batteries so that they will last in the colder temperatures. These are indispensable for getting around at night, reading, etc. so, don’t go cheap here.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Some people like earmuffs; These are optional; a good hat, balaclava, and hooded jacket should really be sufficient, but this is a personal choice for some people (optional).&lt;/li&gt;

 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair warm gloves (heavier fleece or wool).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair shell gloves or mitts; Gore-Tex is preferred for keeping hands dry.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Instant hand warmers are always nice in a pinch, but really shouldn’t be necessary on the trek. Bringing appropriate hand protection as recommended above, should be sufficient (optional).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Core Body&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;

 	&lt;li&gt;2 pairs lightweight long underwear – Capilene or other synthetic.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair soft shell pants – synthetic, full zip from top and bottom preferable.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 pairs trekking pants, preferably that zip on/off at the knees so they double as shorts.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair hard shell pants. Waterproof/breathable, Gore-Tex or equivalent is best. Should zip from the top and bottom – this makes it easier to put on over boots without getting undressed should the weather change once you are underway for the day.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair cotton pants (loose jeans/khakis).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt; All clothing should be kept dry using waterproof stuff sacks or large puncture resistant plastic bags.&lt;/li&gt;

 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair light weight socks, a good option for the lower / warmer parts of the trail.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair light to medium weight waterproof hiking/trekking boots. Ensure a good fit with layered socks and you have worn them before to get used to it (otherwise you will get lots of blister).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair light trekking shoes or sneakers. Good for around the camp/lodges and in Kathmandu.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair hiking gaiters, good for keeping dust and rocks out of your shoes/boots as well as keep your feet dry as necessary (Optional).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair sandals (Optional).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Medicines and First Aid Kits&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Extra Strength Excedrin for altitude related headaches.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Ibuprofen for general aches and pains.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Immodium or Pepto Bismol capsules for upset stomach or diarrhea.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Diamox (commonly prescribed as Acetazolamide) 125 or 250mg tablets for altitude sickness. Please discuss with us before starting to take this medicine.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 small personal sized first-aid kit with blister treatments such as mole skin, band-aids, some waterproof tape, anti-infection ointments, etc. Your guides will have more extensive medical gear, but you should have the basics for general use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;

 	&lt;li&gt;Durable wallet/pouch for travel documents, money &amp;amp; passport.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Lip balm. At least SPF 20, 2 sticks. A string taped to the stick is helpful, to hang around your neck and some are now being sold with a cord already attached. Handy as it avoids you from having to stop and look for it.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Sunscreen. SPF 40 is recommended and should be relatively new since it loses its’ effectiveness over time.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Pocket knife or small Swiss Army type.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Optional&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair adjustable trekking poles. Although these are listed as optional, these can be of great assistance to people who may think of themselves and generally clumsy or with bad knees, ankles, etc especially when going downhill.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Favorite snack foods, no more than 2 pounds.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Paperback books, cards, mp3 player (there are a couple of stops where you could recharge. Avoid players with moving hardware as it may not function. Remember, keep these items lightweight.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Binoculars.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 light weight point &amp;amp; shoot camera or 1 large SLR. Digital cameras are ok, but you must keep the batteries warm when not in use.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Hydration bladder with drinking tube and tube insulator.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;A pee bottle for men and pee funnel for woman, some swear by them to avoid that chilly late night trip.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 small stainless steel thermos.&lt;/li&gt;

During this Kanchenjunga trek, you will have a glimpse of snow leopard, Himalayan black bear, musk deer, and red panda. It is the abode of gods who grant prosperity and goodwill on them and their lands, while to the climbers of this mountain the phrase “<em>five great treasuries of the snow</em>” takes on a slightly more ominous tone.

The weight limit for Kathmandu-Biratnagar-Kathmandu and Biratnagar-Taplejung-Biratnagar flights is 15 kg or 33 pounds. This is combining both the duffel bag and the daypack. If you exceed this limit, you will have to pay an additional fee. When this happens, sometimes the airline sends your bag in later flights and this can be very problematic for many reasons. So, we recommend you to pack as carefully as you can and not exceed the weight limit. You can leave your non-trekking stuff at the locker facility in the Kathmandu hotel.

 	&lt;li&gt;Experience the culture of Sherpa people.&lt;/li&gt;

heavy items are carried by porters or yaks and personal belongings that you may need for the day like money, water bottle, rain gear, camera, sun cream and toilet paper etc. should be carried by yourself. So you are briefed to pack items in two different bags.
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Climbing gear&lt;/h4&gt;
The Climbing equipments are much more expensive to buy. So, please let us know if you want to rent the equipments at the additional cost of USD 250 per person. The Following equipments are essential for climbing the peak.
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 Pair plastic shell mountaineering boots with high altitude liners&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 Pair of crampons (steel, no aluminum).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 Alpine climbing harness.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 Mountaineering axe with leash (sized properly for your height)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 Ascender (right or left handed as appropriate)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 Belay device (Black Diamond ATC or ATC Guide are good options)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 D-Shaped locking carabiners&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 Non-locking carabiners&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 Pair expedition style gaiters (ensure fit over your boots)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Neck gaiter&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Ski goggles&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Climbing helmet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;General&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;4 seasons Sleeping bag (Optional/we can provide one if you need it but is to be returned after the trek)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Duffel or Rucksack bag or suitcase (We will provide one complimentary ACE duffel bag for you to keep.)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Daypack&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Down Jacket (Optional/we can provide if you need one but is to be returned after the trek)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Upper Body - Head / Ears / Eyes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Shade hat or baseball cap – some people drape a bandana down the back of their head and then put a baseball cap on to hold it. This can be a flexible alternative while keeping the sun off your ears and neck.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Warm wool or synthetic hat that cover your ears.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Balaclava – lightweight, thinner variety.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Glacier glasses-100% UV protection with side shields and a hard-sided storage case (i.e. Julbo or Cebe). This is to protect your eyes from the stronger rays of the sun due to the thinner atmosphere which can cause a painful condition known as snow blindness. Regular sunglasses are not sufficient. If you wear prescription glasses, speak to your doctor about prescription glacier glasses, perhaps with transitional lenses.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Headlamp – Black Diamond and Petzl both make several good ones. Make sure to bring extra batteries and that they are lithium batteries so that they will last in the colder temperatures. These are indispensable for getting around at night, reading, etc. so, don’t go cheap here.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Some people like earmuffs; These are optional; a good hat, balaclava, and hooded jacket should really be sufficient, but this is a personal choice for some people.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;A neck warmer is another piece of gear for extra warmth if you feel you will need it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Hand&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair liner gloves, thin wool or synthetic, useful alone on mild days or as a layer inside another gloves/mitts for additional warmth.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair warm gloves (heavier fleece or wool).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair shell gloves or mitts; Gore-Tex is preferred for keeping hands dry.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Hand warmers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Core Body&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;T-shirts (2).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Light and expedition weight thermal tops.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Fleece jacket or pullover.&lt;/li&gt;

 	&lt;li&gt;2 women sports bras, Synthetic, no cotton!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 pairs nylon hiking shorts – Quick drying type, not cotton!&lt;/li&gt;

 	&lt;li&gt;2 pairs lightweight long underwear – Capilene or other synthetic.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair soft shell pants – synthetic, full zip from top and bottom preferable.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 pairs trekking pants, preferably that zip on/off at the knees so they double as shorts.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair hard shell pants. Waterproof/breathable, Gore-Tex or equivalent is best. Should zip from the top and bottom – this makes it easier to put on over boots without getting undressed should the weather change once you are underway for the day.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair cotton pants (loose jeans/khakis).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt; All clothing should be kept dry using waterproof stuff sacks or large puncture resistant plastic bags.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Feet&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;4 pairs of liner socks, synthetic or Capilene.&lt;/li&gt;

 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair light to medium weight waterproof hiking/trekking boots. Ensure a good fit with layered socks and you have worn them before to get used to it (otherwise you will get lots of blister).&lt;/li&gt;

 	&lt;li&gt;Diamox (commonly prescribed as Acetazolamide) 125 or 250 mg tablets for altitude sickness. Please discuss with us before starting to take this medicine.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 small personal sized first-aid kit with blister treatments such as mole skin, band-aids, some waterproof tape, anti-infection ointments, etc. Your guides will have more extensive medical gear, but you should have the basics for general use.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Optional&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair adjustable trekking poles. Although these are listed as optional, these can be of great assistance to people who may think of themselves and generally clumsy or with bad knees, ankles, etc, especially when going downhill&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Favorite snack foods, no more than 2 pounds&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Paperback books, cards, mp3 player (there are a couple of stops where you could recharge. Avoid players with moving hardware as it may not function. Remember, keep these items lightweight&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Binoculars&lt;/li&gt;

Leaving Pisang, we have a choice between trails heading north and south of the Marsyangdi River, meeting up again at Mungji.

We start climbing up a steep path that is regularly used and easy to follow. Problems may arise, however, due to the high altitude and snow. Snow often makes the crossing for more difficult. About four hours’ climb we’ll reach the pass, marked by chortens and prayer flags. At the top we’ll be rewarded by the magnificent view, after which another four will take us to the holy town of Muktinath (3800m).
Muktinath, meaning “place of Nirvana,” is home to the Muktinath temple as well as several monasteries.

Two clients share one porter. We will supply you with a trek duffel bag where you keep your heavy items and this bag is carried by the porter. You will need to bring your own daypack to be carried by you. In the daypack, you can put money, important documents, water bottle/bladder, camera, toiletries, sunscreen, notebook, etc.

The weight limit for Kathmandu-Lukla-Kathmandu flights is 15 kg or 33 pounds. This is combining both the duffel bag and the daypack. If you exceed this limit, you will have to pay an additional fee. When this happens, sometimes the airline sends your bag in later flights and this can be very problematic for many reasons. You can leave your non-trekking stuff at the locker facility in the Kathmandu hotel.

heavy items are carried by porters or mules and personal belongings that you may need for the day like money, water bottle, rain gear, camera, sun cream and toilet paper etc. should be carried by yourself. So you are briefed to pack items in two different bags.
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;General&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;4 seasons Sleeping bag (we can provide one if you need it but is to be returned after the trek)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Duffel or Rucksack bag or suitcase&lt;/li&gt;

 	&lt;li&gt;Down Jacket&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Upper Body - Head / Ears / Eyes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Shade hat or baseball cap – some people drape a bandana down the back of their head and then put a baseball cap on to hold it. This can be a flexible alternative while keeping the sun off your ears and neck.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Warm wool or synthetic hat that cover your ears.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Balaclava – lightweight, thinner variety.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Glacier glasses-100% UV protection with side shields and a hard-sided storage case (i.e. Julbo or Cebe). This is to protect your eyes from the h3er rays of the sun due to the thinner atmosphere which can cause a painful condition known as snow blindness. Regular sunglasses are not sufficient. If you wear prescription glasses, speak to your doctor about prescription glacier glasses, perhaps with transitional lenses.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Headlamp – Black Diamond and Petzl both make several good ones. Make sure to bring extra batteries and that they are lithium batteries so that they will last in the colder temperatures. These are indispensable for getting around at night, reading, etc. so, don’t go cheap here.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Some people like earmuffs; These are optional; a good hat, balaclava, and hooded jacket should really be sufficient, but this is a personal choice for some people (optional).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;A neck warmer is another piece of gear for extra warmth if you feel you will need it (optional).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Hand&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair liner gloves, thin wool or synthetic, useful alone on mild days or as a layer inside other gloves/mitts for additional warmth.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair warm gloves (heavier fleece or wool).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair shell gloves or mitts; Gore-Tex is preferred for keeping hands dry.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Instant hand warmers are always nice in a pinch, but really shouldn’t be necessary on the trek.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Bringing appropriate hand protection as recommended above, should be sufficient (optional).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Core Body&lt;/h4&gt;

An interesting aspect of the falls is that the water disappears in a tunnel which is approximately 500 feet long and runs 100 feet below ground level .In 1961, a Swiss tourist who was swimming in the Fewa Lake was swept away in an unexpected current due to the overflow in a dam. His wife, who was nearby, could not save him, and his body was never recovered. The fall was named after him as “&lt;em&gt;Davis Falls&lt;/em&gt;” In Nepali, it is called Patale Chhango, which means “&lt;em&gt;Underworld Waterfall&lt;/em&gt;”.
&lt;h4&gt;Gupteshwor Mahadev Gufa&lt;/h4&gt;
Gupteshwor Mahadev Cave was not discovered until 1992 but is believed to have formed 500 years ago. When the group of local people found the cave they also found sketch of Shiva Lingas; symbols of Lord Shiva and they also found out that the cave was one of the openings of the Patale Chhango, Davi’s fall. Later a temple inside the cave dedicated to Lord Shiva was built.
&lt;h4&gt;Bat Cave&lt;/h4&gt;
Bat Cave, in Nepali language, it is also called Chamero Gufa as Chamero means Bat and Gufa means Cave. It is named Bat Cave as bats habitats the cave’s wall and the ceilings.
&lt;h4&gt;Mahendra Gufa&lt;/h4&gt;
The cave is named after the name of the Late king Mahendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev. The cave itself is amazing and we can see the various natural shapes and images of the various Hindu god and goddess on the stone made of the lime. The area is surrounded by the community forest at the hillside and at the end of road there flows the small river called the Kali Khola."";s:10:""7_wpeditor"";s:0:"""";s:12:""map_wpeditor"";s:0:"""";s:10:""8_wpeditor"";s:0:"""";}s:9:""itinerary"";a:3:{s:15:""itinerary_title"";a:1:{i:1;s:38:""Full day Leisure Activities in Pokhara"";}s:17:""itinerary_content"";a:1:{i:1;s:1564:""5:30 am

The tour cost includes an English speaking guide, packed lunch, mountain bike and helmet. You can also extend your trip to Pokhara, Chitwan and many other beautiful places. You can choose either one of the single track to explore:
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mudkhu-Tokha Trail&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
This trail is perfect for beginners and within easy reach from Thamel. You only need half a day for this ride as it takes about 3 to 4 hours to complete this trail and be back at your hotel.
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Scar Road&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
One of the most challenging trails in Kathmandu, the route goes to Kakani (2,030 m), an excellent hill station on the valley rim, and then to Budhanilkantha, and comes back to your hotel in Kathmandu. You will need 5 to 6 hours for this route.
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budhanilkantha-Kapan Trail &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
This technical ride, which takes about 5 to 6 hours, starts from Kathmandu, heads to Budhanilkantha and then to Kapan and returns back to your hotel in Kathmandu. The route goes through two Buddhist monasteries. If you are interested and have time, you can visit the &lt;em&gt;gompas (monasteries)&lt;/em&gt; and interact with nuns and monks.
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jamacho Route &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
This is another biking route within easy reach from Thamel but harder than Mudhkhu-Tokha Trail. This moderate ride takes you on a 21-km serpentine road to the top of Nagarjun Hill (2128m) inside Shivapuri National Park. The top viewpoint offers some of the amazing views. It takes about 5 to 6 hours to complete.

Your bicycle can be carried as part of your baggage allowance on international flights. You are required to deflate the tyres, turn the handlebars parallel with the frame and remove the pedals. Passage through Nepali customs is quite simple once you reassure airport officers that it is ‘your’ bicycle and it will also be returning with you, though this requirement is never enforced.

On most domestic flights, if you pack your bicycle correctly, removing wheels and pedals, it is possible to load it in the cargo hold. Check with the airline first.

Local buses are useful if you wish to avoid some of the routes that carry heavy traffic. You can place your bicycle on the roof for an additional charge (Rs 50 to Rs 100 depending on the length of the journey and the bus company). Keep in mind that more baggage is likely to be loaded on top once you’re inside. A lock and chain is a wise investment."";i:2;s:913:""Nepali roads carry a vast array of vehicles: buses, motorcycles, cars, trucks, tractors, holy cows, wheelbarrows, dogs, wandering children and chickens, all moving at different speeds and in different directions. Traffic generally travels on the left-hand side, though it’s not uncommon to find a vehicle approaching you head-on. In practice, smaller vehicles give way to larger ones, and bicycles are definitely at the bottom of the heap.

A few intrepid mountain bikers have taken bicycles into trekking areas such as the Annapurna Circuit and, more recently, the Mansalu Circuit, hoping to find great riding, but you have to be prepared to carry your bicycle for at least 30% of the time. In addition, there are always trekkers, porters and local people clogging up the trails. Sagarmatha National Park doesn’t allow mountain bikes. Courtesy and care on the trails should be a high priority when cycling."";i:3;s:409:""Tight-fitting lycra bicycle clothing might be functional, but it's a shock to locals, who maintain a very modest approach to dressing. Such clothing is embarrassing and also offensive to Nepalis.

A simple way to overcome this is by wearing a pair of comfortable shorts and a T-shirt over your bicycle gear. This is especially applicable to female cyclists, as women in Nepal generally dress conservatively."";i:4;s:581:""Trails are often filled with locals going about their daily work. A small bell attached to your handlebars and used as a warning of your approach, reducing your speed, and a friendly call or two of ‘cycle ioh!’ (cycle coming!) go a long way in keeping everyone on the trails happy and safe. Children love the novelty of the bicycles, the fancy helmets, the colours and the strange clothing, and will come running from all directions to greet you. They also love to grab hold of the back of your bicycle and run with you. You need to maintain a watchful eye so no one gets hurt."";i:5;s:430:""When you book biking tour with us, we will supply you the high quality international brands like Cube, Trek or Giant hardtail, helmet, lock and basic repair kit.

If you bring your own bicycle, it is essential to bring tools and spare parts, as these are largely unavailable outside of Kathmandu. Established mountain-bike tour operators have mechanics, workshops and a full range of bicycle tools at their offices in Kathmandu."";}}s:3:""map"";a:2:{s:9:""image_url"";s:0:"""";s:6:""iframe"";s:0:"""";}}",,,4,54,45,90,offer,article,"<div class=""preview_img"" style=""background-image:url(https://res.cloudinary.com/trekkingtopnepal/image/upload/c_crop,h_1280,w_1280,x_320,y_0/h_150,w_150/v1544804427/cycling-2520007_cjsdeo.jpg);""></div>","Kathmandu valley offers the amazing day tour experience for all levels of riders.

 	&lt;li&gt;Jomsom (2700m), starting point of Downhill Hiking offers the finest view of Dhaulagiri ranges.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Enjoy the best single track, zigzag trail, a sharp turn, at the motarable bank of Kaligandaki&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Steep uphill ride to sacred Muktinath Temple.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Real taste of remote Nepal in Marpha village.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Swimming at natural hotspring water.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Enjoy the natural serenity of Pokhara.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;"";s:10:""5_wpeditor"";s:8119:""During your biking tour, the entire heavy items are carried/transfer by porters and vehicular transport. Personal belongings that you may need for the day like money, water bottle, rain gear, camera, sun cream and toilet paper etc. should be carried by yourself. So you are briefed to pack items in two different bags.
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Riding Kit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Bike gloves – 3 pairs&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Biking glasses&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Padded cycling shorts (to last at least 5 rides)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Long-sleeved base layers&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Short-sleeved and long-sleeved cycling tops&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Biking socks (at least 5 pairs)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Hat and non-biking gloves&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Head torch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
If you’re bringing your own bike:
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Brake pads specific to your bike – 2 sets&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Rear mech hanger specific to your bike – 2&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Bottle of dry lube&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Four inner tubes, or spare bottle of fluid for&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;tubeless tyres (two for each tyre)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Quick link to suit your chain&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;For 29” wheels bring extra spare tubes; these are more difficult to find in Nepal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;General&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;4 seasons Sleeping bag (we can provide one if you need it but is to be returned after the trek)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Duffel or Rucksack bag or suitcase&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Daypack&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Down Jacket (we can provide if you need one but is to be returned after the trek)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Upper Body - Head / Ears / Eyes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Shade hat or baseball cap – some people drape a bandana down the back of their head and then put a baseball cap on to hold it. This can be a flexible alternative while keeping the sun off your ears and neck.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Warm wool or synthetic hat that covers your ears ( only if you are traveling in the cold season i.e January, February, November and December)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Goggles or sunglasses for sunbeam, dust and wind.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Headlamp – Black Diamond and Petzl both make several good ones. Make sure to bring extra batteries and that they are lithium batteries so that they will last in the colder temperatures. These are indispensable for getting around at night, reading, etc. so, don’t go cheap here.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Some people like earmuffs; These are optional; a good hat, balaclava, and hooded jacket should really be sufficient, but this is a personal choice for some people.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;A neck warmer is another piece of gear for extra warmth if you feel you will need it and is for cold season.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Hand&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair liner gloves, thin wool or synthetic, useful alone on mild days or as a layer inside another gloves/mitts for additional warmth.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair warm gloves (This is required if you are traveling in cold season i.e January, February, November and December).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Instant hand warmers are always nice in a pinch, but really shouldn’t be necessary on the trek. Bringing appropriate hand protection as recommended above, should be sufficient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Core Body&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;T-shirts (2).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Fleece jacket or pullover.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Fleece Wind-Stopper jacket&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Waterproof (preferably breathable fabric) shell jacket.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 women sports bras, Synthetic, no cotton!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Lower Body – Legs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 pairs nylon hiking shorts – Quick drying type, not cotton!&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Underwear, stay away from cotton (4).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 pairs lightweight long underwear – Capilene or other synthetic.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair soft shell pants – synthetic, full zip from top and bottom preferable.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 pairs trekking pants, preferably that zip on/off at the knees so they double as shorts.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair cotton pants (loose jeans/khakis).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt; All clothing should be kept dry using waterproof stuff sacks or large puncture resistant plastic bags.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Feet&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 pairs of liner socks, synthetic or Capilene.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 pairs heavy weight socks to be worn over liner socks preferable for cold season.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 pair lightweight socks, a good option for the lower/warmer parts of the trail.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair light trekking shoes or sneakers. Good for around the camp/lodges and in Kathmandu.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair hiking gaiters, good for keeping dust and rocks out of your shoes/boots as well as keep your feet dry as necessary&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair sandals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;First Aid Kits&lt;/h4&gt;
Please note our guide will also carry the first aid kit bag during the trek. However, we still recommend you to bring your personal first aid kit as well.
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Extra Strength Excedrin for altitude related headaches.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Ibuprofen for general aches and pains.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Immodium or Pepto Bismol capsules for upset stomach or diarrhea.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 small personal sized first-aid kit with blister treatments such as mole skin, band-aids, some waterproof tape, anti-infection ointments, etc. Your guides will have more extensive medical gear, but you should have the basics for general use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;

 	&lt;li&gt;Durable wallet/pouch for travel documents, money &amp;amp; passport.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Lip balm. At least SPF 20, 2 sticks. A string taped to the stick is helpful, to hang around your neck and some are now being sold with a cord already attached. Handy as it avoids you from having to stop and look for it.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Sunscreen. SPF 40 is recommended and should be relatively new since it loses its’ effectiveness over time.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Pocket knife or small Swiss Army type.&lt;/li&gt;

 	&lt;li&gt;Binoculars&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 light weight point &amp;amp; shoot camera or 1 large SLR. Digital cameras are ok, but you must keep the batteries warm when not in use&lt;/li&gt;

After the pre-trip meeting, your biking trip will start at around 8:45 am. You will have a support vehicle and a professional Biking guide at your disposal. We will then assemble our bikes and head toward the northern side of the valley for our adventurous bike ride. We ride through the lush green valley via Balaju – Mudkhu – Chaurgoan – Jhor – Tokha – Budhanilkhanta (47kms) that will take around 4 to 5 hrs. This is the best single track in the northern side of the valley. The Zigzag way through the rice paddies and semi-rural local villages and you can test your skill on some fine sections of single track. The ride combines sharp, steep climbs, sweet downhills. There are many variations on this route so you can choose and take assistance from your guide depending on your fitness and skill. Lunch can be done on the way at various restaurants available."";i:3;s:519:""Our staff will pick you up at the hotel at 6:30 am and escort you to the bus station. The bus to Pokhara leaves at around 7:30 am, and the drive is 6 hours including lunch on the way. A beautiful valley set on the banks of the Phewa Lake, Pokhara is also known for its panoramic views of Annapurna, Machapuchare (shape of fish tail) in the north, Dhaulagiri in the west, Lamjung Himal and Manaslu in the east. It is smaller and much less hectic than Kathmandu, hence providing the perfect place to relax in the evening."";i:4;s:748:""There are numerous flights that service the Jomsom airstrip early each day before the Kali Gandaki wind picks up by mid-morning. To get used to the altitude and the weather condition, we assemble the bikes as soon as we land in Jomsom and ride the relatively flat river trail to Kagbeni, the border-town of the recently forbidden Kingdom, Mustang.

As we head towards Muktinath. This is the highest point of this trip. The landscape is extremely dry and desert-like. You may come across a handful of trekkers and pilgrims, mainly from India, on their way to the holy temple with the eternal flame in Muktinath that burns from a natural gas source. Reaching the culturally and religiously site with stunning mountain views is quite an achievement."";i:5;s:522:""With thrilling views of the Dhaulagiri and several other 8,000m peaks on our sight we begin our descent. On the way, we pass yak herds and experience the centuries-old lifestyle of the local people. We ride through Lupra where black magic and human sacrifices (on dead bodies) are a part of the community rituals. We call it a day in Marpha – a picturesque community known for its apple orchards. The flagstone-lined village of Marpha is popular for apple farming. Don’t forget to try some local apple wine and brandy."";i:6;s:371:""With a fantastic downhill ahead of us, we begin our descent towards Tato Pani (hot water), which in the local language means hot water.

<div>Namobuddha (or <em>Namura</em>) is for Tibetans one of the three holiest pilgrimage sites south of the Himalaya. Legends say a young prince, Mahasattva (reincarnation of Buddha himself) while walking in a forest with his brothers saw a tigress with 5 cubs she had just given birth to.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The tigress was so hungry that she could barely move. Overcome with compassion, he began to feed the tigress and her cubs by cutting his flesh. Later when other brothers came searching for him, found only his bones and hairs. A stupa was built on top of these remains, now known as Namobuddha.</div>

1112,"Chitwan National Park Safari Wildlife Discovery","Chitwan National Park Safari is one of the premier draw cards in Nepal. This World Heritage–listed reserve consists of marshland and grassland containing sizeable animal populations. It is one of the best national parks for viewing wildlife in Asia.

You'll have an excellent chance of spotting one-horned rhinos, deer, monkeys and some of the more than 500 species of birds. If luck favors, you may spot a leopard, wild elephant or sloth bear. It’s the once-in-a-lifetime chance to spot a majestic royal Bengal tiger. 

You'll also have the chance to experience domesticated elephants, although how that interaction takes place is now undergoing a paradigm shift driven by animal rights concerns.

The diverse flora and fauna are easily seen year-round, with each season offering its special delight. During the March-June season, a mysterious sun-lit fog covers the land.  The short grass time of Feb-May offers the best game-viewing season, and the autumn months are the best time to see gorgeous Himalayan views.

Bring your camera! On our Chitwan Chitwan National Park Safari Wildlife Discovery, you may see a one-horned rhino, royal Bengal tiger, wild elephant, deer, wild boar, sloth bear, leopard, bison, or jackal.  Many reptiles including the gharial crocodile live there, as do many species of the birds including hornbill, lesser florican, paradise flycatcher, and others.  A photographer’s haven, Chitwan is easily accessible, linked by river, highway, and air transport, with regular flights, river rafting, and tourist bus service from Kathmandu and Pokhara."";s:10:""5_wpeditor"";s:550:""&lt;div class=&quot;top-bar-content&quot;&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hotel in Chitwan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
To get you the best hotel value, Osho World Adventure suggests that you stay outside of the park hotels.  Staying inside the park is very expensive.  There is so much to see and do at Chitwan that we highly recommend staying 3 or more nights!   Please inquire for details to help us design a Chitwan Jungle Safari trip to be your most memorable vacation ever!

&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Shade hat or baseball cap – some people drape a bandana down the back of their head and then put a baseball cap on to hold it. This can be a flexible alternative while keeping the sun off your ears and neck.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Warm wool or synthetic hat that covers your ears (only if you are traveling in the cold season i.e January, February, November and December)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Goggles or sunglasses for sunbeam, dust and wind.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Headlamp – Black Diamond and Petzl both make several good ones. Make sure to bring extra batteries and that they are lithium batteries so that they will last in the colder temperatures. These are indispensable for getting around at night, reading, etc. so, don’t go cheap here.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Some people like earmuffs; These are optional; a good hat, balaclava, and hooded jacket should really be sufficient, but this is a personal choice for some people.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;A neck warmer is another piece of gear for extra warmth if you feel you will need it and is for cold season.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Hand&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;

 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair warm gloves (This is required if you are traveling in cold season i.e January, February, November and December).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Instant hand warmers are always nice in a pinch, but really shouldn’t be necessary on the trek. Bringing appropriate hand protection as recommended above, should be sufficient (optional).&lt;/li&gt;

 	&lt;li&gt;Underwear, stay away from cotton (4).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 pairs lightweight long underwear – Capilene or other synthetic.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair soft shell pants – synthetic, full zip from top and bottom preferable.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 pairs trekking pants, preferably that zip on/off at the knees so they double as shorts..&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair cotton pants (loose jeans/khakis).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt; All clothing should be kept dry using waterproof stuff sacks or large puncture resistant plastic bags.&lt;/li&gt;

 	&lt;li&gt;2 pairs heavy weight socks to be worn over liner socks preferable for cold season.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 pair light weight socks, a good option for the lower / warmer parts of the trail.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair light to medium weight waterproof hiking/trekking boots. Ensure a good fit with layered socks and you have worn them before to get used to it (otherwise you will get lots of blister).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair light trekking shoes or sneakers. Good for around the camp/lodges and in Kathmandu.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair hiking gaiters, good for keeping dust and rocks out of your shoes / boots as well as keep your feet dry as necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair sandals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;First Aid Kits&lt;/h4&gt;
Please note our guide will also carry the first aid kit bag during the trek. However, we still recommend you to bring your personal first aid kit as well.
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Extra Strength Excedrin for altitude related headaches.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Ibuprofen for general aches and pains.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Immodium or Pepto Bismol capsules for upset stomach or diarrhea.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Diamox (commonly prescribed as Acetazolamide) 125 or 250mg tablets for altitude sickness. Please discuss with us before starting to take this medicine.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 small personal sized first-aid kit with blister treatments such as mole skin, band-aids, some waterproof tape, anti-infection ointments, etc. Your guides will have more extensive medical gear, but you should have the basics for general use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Passport and extra passport photos (4 copies).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Airline ticket (Please make a copy and leave on at our office in KTM just in case if you need to change the date of your).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Durable wallet/pouch for travel documents, money &amp;amp; passport.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Lip balm. At least SPF 20, 2 sticks. A string taped to the stick is helpful, to hang around your neck and some are now being sold with a cord already attached. Handy as it avoids you from having to stop and look for it.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Sunscreen. SPF 40 is recommended and should be relatively new since it loses its’ effectiveness over time.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Pocket knife or small Swiss Army type.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Water purification Iodine tablets or Polar-pure crystals.&lt;/li&gt;

 	&lt;li&gt;2 bandanas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Optional&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair adjustable trekking poles. Although these are listed as optional, these can be of great assistance to people who may think of themselves and generally clumsy or with bad knees, ankles, etc, especially when going downhill&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Favorite snack foods, no more than 2 lbs&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Paperback books, cards, mp3 player (there are a couple of stops where you could recharge. Avoid players with moving hardware as it may not function.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Binoculars&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 light weight point &amp;amp; shoot camera or 1 large SLR. Digital cameras are ok, but you must keep the batteries warm when not in use&lt;/li&gt;

 	&lt;li&gt;A pee bottle for men and pee funnel for the women&lt;/li&gt;

Bhaktapur Durbar Square
Bhaktapur Durbar Square is a collection of pagoda and shikhara – style temples grouped around a fifty-five-window palace of brick and wood. The attraction of the Bhaktapur Durbar Square is the Lion gate, the Golden gate, the Palace of fifty-five windows, art galleries, and the statue of King Bhupatindra Malla.

Changunarayan Temple
The temple is situated on a ridge overlooking the Kathmandu valley, about 12 km east of the city. Dedicated to the Hindu God Vishnu, it is one of the finest and oldest specimens of pagoda architecture built in 323 AD by King Haridatta Verma. The temple is richly decorated with sculptures and carvings, and its position above the Kathmandu valley affords a beautiful view of the surrounding countryside."";i:3;s:1042:""Khokana and Bungamati Village
Founded in the 7th century, Bungamati is home to one of the most important God of the Kathmandu Valley, Matsyendranath or the God of Rain &amp; Compassion. Worshipped equally by Hindus and Buddhists, the god is accredited by local people with the introduction of rice plantations in the valley. The rich heritage and relatively unchanging lifestyle of the Newar people are clear to see both in Bungamati and in the nearby village of Khokana, which we also visit.

Patan Durbar Square
Patan Durbar Square is an enchanting combination of palace buildings, artistic courtyards and graceful pagoda temples. The former royal palace complex is the center of Patan’s religious and social life, and houses a museum containing an array of bronze statues and religious objects. One remarkable monument here is a 17th-century temple dedicated to the Hindu god Krishna, built entirely of stone.

We will then have an hour of scenic drive to Nagarkot, famous for its vantage point of mountains and sunrise and sunset."";i:4;s:253:""After an early breakfast we head to Pokhara on a tourist vehicle which is about six to seven hours drive. The notorious Prithvi Highway, which winds through 206 km of classic Middle Hills countryside, should be seen as more than just a painful bus ride."";i:5;s:1424:""Your sightseeing trip will start after breakfast. We provide a private vehicle and a professional tour guide. The places we visit are as below:

Bindhyabasini Temple
Lies in the center of religious old bazaar. It is dedicated to Goddess Bhagwati, yet another manifestation of Shakti. The park grounds offer a fine picnic and relaxing area.

Begnas and Rupa Lakes
The two lakes lie in the north-east of the Pokhara valley at a distance of 13kms from the main city of Pokhara. These lakes are located at the foothill of Begnas, mountain and are separated by the Pachabiya hill.

Davis Falls
Locally known as Patale Chhango, these amazing waterfalls lie in the southern flank of the Pokhara. Here  the stream flowing from Phewa lake collapses and surges down the rock into a deep gorge, leaping through several potholes. This is hugely popular with tourists and locals alike.

Gupteswar Cave
The revered Gupteswar Cave is situated 2 kms from Pokhara airport. The entrance is right across from Davis Falls and the cave is almost 3 kms long. It has some big hall-sized rooms and some passages where you have to crawl on all four. This cave holds special value to Hindus since a phallic symbol of Lord Shiva is preserved here in the condition it was discovered.

Mahendra cave
Lies at the north of the Pokhara valley. It is a large limestone cave which is one of the few stalagmites stalactite caves found in Nepal."";i:6;s:1509:""Museums
During the tour, we will visit two different museums: one museum displays the lifestyles and history of the Gurungs, Thakalis and Tharu, while the other, Gurkha Memorial Museum, is dedicated to the famous Gurkha Warriors who earned their name in many fierce battles fought during the World Wars and numerous operations around the world since 1815. The soldiers of the Gurkha regiment won 13 Victoria Cross medals awarded for exceptional bravery shown in the field.

Phewa Lake and Barahi Temple
Situated at an altitude of 800m above sea level, Phewa is the second largest lake in the kingdom.  The Barahi Island Temple, which lies in the middle of the lake, is dedicated to the Goddess Barahi. This two-storied pagoda temple is dedicated to the female force Shakti. The reflection of Mt. Machhapuchhare and Annapurna can be seen in its serene water. Thick forest lies on the adjoining southern slopes of the lake.

Seti River Gorge
Carved by Seti-Gandaki, the gorge is one of the natural wonders of Pokhara. K.I. Singh bridge at Bagar, Mahendrapool &amp; Prithivi highway Bridge near bus park, provides a perfect view of the river’s dreadful rush and the deep gorge made by the turbulent flow of white water.

Tibetan Refugee Camp
The Tibetan village Tashiling in the south and the Tashi Palkhiel village in the north of Pokhara are renowned for the production and trade of woolen carpets and other handicrafts. The original Tibetan settlers in this region migrated to Nepal in the ‘50s."";i:7;s:809:""Wake up early to catch the sunrise from Sarangkot Hill.
Sarangkot
A drive of 45 minutes with 25 minutes hike brings us to the view point of Sarangkot. It is the best spot in Pokhara to view the Himalayas. Get mesmerized with the magical sight of the golden sun rising over white spires of the Annapurna range, Dhaulagiri and Machhapucchre (Fishtail Peak), including views of the beautiful the Pokhara Valley and Phewa Lake. It takes about 15-minute walk down and 45 minutes’ drive to the hotel in Pokhara. Return to hotel for breakfast.

We provide a private vehicle and a professional tour guide. The places we visit are UNESCO World Heritage Sites of:

Boudhanath Stupa 
It lies about 6 kms east of Kathmandu and is the largest stupa in the valley. It looms 36 meters high and presents one of the most fascinating specimens of stupa design. Buddhanath is also known as Khasti, or dew drops, after an account that builders had to use dew to mix the mortar as Kathmandu was suffering from a severe drought during the construction of Bouddhanath.

Swayambhunath Stupa – The Monkey Temple 
The temple watches over the valley from the top of a hillock on its western side. The huge stupa is one of the holiest Buddhist sites in Nepal and its establishment is linked to the creation of the Kathmandu Valley out of a primordial lake. Swayambhu is also known as Samhengu and the Monkey temple because of the countless monkeys living in the premises.

Pashupatinath Temple 
Pashupatinath is one of the most sacred Hindu shrines in the world and lies 5 kms east of the city center. The richly-ornamented pagoda houses the sacred Linga, or phallic symbol, of Lord Shiva. Chronicles indicate the temple’s existence prior to 400 AD. Devotees can be seen taking ritual dips in the holy Bagmati River flowing beside the temple.

Kathmandu Durbar Square 
This complex of palaces, courtyards and temples, built between the 12th and 18th centuries, used to be the seat of the ancient Malla kings of Kathmandu. An intriguing piece here is the 17th- century stone inscription set into the wall of the palace with writings in 15 languages. The Durbar Square is the social, religious and urban focal point of the city. There are also three museums inside the palace building."";i:11;s:683:""Early in the morning, you will be transferred to the domestic airport for your Everest flight. The one-hour flight takes you within the camera range of some of the highest peaks in the world, and cruising this close to the awe-inspiring massifs of rock and ice, is an out-of-this-world experience. This special mountain flight offers the closest possible aerial views of Mt. Everest, Kanchenjunga and many other giants, as well as the Tibetan Plateau.

After returning to Kathmandu, you have the afternoon and the evening to stroll along the streets of Kathmandu for some last-minute shopping.

The rich heritage and relatively unchanging lifestyle of the Newar people are clear to see both in Bungamati and in the nearby village of Khokana, which we also visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patan Durbar Square&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patan Durbar Square is an enchanting combination of palace buildings, artistic courtyards and graceful pagoda temples. The former royal palace complex is the center of Patan’s religious and social life, and houses a museum containing an array of bronze statues and religious objects. One remarkable monument here is a 17th-century temple dedicated to the Hindu god Krishna, built entirely of stone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will then have an hour of scenic drive to Nagarkot, famous for its vantage point of mountains and sunrise and sunset.&lt;/p&gt;"";i:4;s:272:""&lt;p&gt;After an early breakfast we head to Pokhara on a tourist vehicle which is about six to seven hours drive. The notorious Prithvi Highway, which winds through 206 km of classic Middle Hills countryside, should be seen as more than just a painful bus ride.&lt;/p&gt;"";i:5;s:1699:""&lt;p&gt;Your sightseeing trip will start after breakfast. We provide a private vehicle and a professional tour guide. The places we visit are as below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bindhyabasini Temple&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lies in the center of religious old bazaar. It is dedicated to Goddess Bhagawati, yet another manifestation of Shakti. The park grounds offer a fine picnic and relaxing area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Begnas and Rupa Lakes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two lakes lie in the north-east of the Pokhara valley at a distance of 13kms from the main city of Pokhara. These lakes are located at the foothill of Begnas, mountain and are separated by the Pachabiya hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis Falls&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Locally known as Patale Chhango, these amazing waterfalls lie in the southern flank of the Pokhara. Here  the stream flowing from Phewa lake collapses and surges down the rock into a deep gorge, leaping through several potholes. This is hugely popular with tourists and locals alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupteswar Cave&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The revered Gupteswar Cave is situated 2 kms from Pokhara airport. The entrance is right across from Davis Falls and the cave is almost 3 kms long. It has some big hall-sized rooms and some passages where you have to crawl on all four. This cave holds special value to Hindus since a phallic symbol of Lord Shiva is preserved here in the condition it was discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahendra cave&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lies at the north of the Pokhara valley. It is a large limestone cave which is one of the few stalagmites stalactite caves found in Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;"";i:6;s:1698:""&lt;p&gt;Museums&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the tour, we will visit two different museums: one museum displays the lifestyles and history of the Gurungs, Thakalis and Tharu, while the other, Gurkha Memorial Museum, is dedicated to the famous Gurkha Warriors who earned their name in many fierce battles fought during the World Wars and numerous operations around the world since 1815. The soldiers of the Gurkha regiment won 13 Victoria Cross medals awarded for exceptional bravery shown in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phewa Lake and Barahi Temple&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Situated at an altitude of 800m above sea level, Phewa is the second largest lake in the kingdom.  The Barahi Island Temple, which lies in the middle of the lake, is dedicated to the Goddess Barahi. This two-storied pagoda temple is dedicated to the female force Shakti. The reflection of Mt. Machhapuchhare and Annapurna can be seen in its serene water. Thick forest lies on the adjoining southern slopes of the lake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seti River Gorge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carved by Seti-Gandaki, the gorge is one of the natural wonders of Pokhara. K.I. Singh bridge at Bagar, Mahendrapool &amp; Prithivi highway Bridge near bus park, provides a perfect view of the river’s dreadful rush and the deep gorge made by the turbulent flow of white water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tibetan Refugee Camp&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tibetan village Tashiling in the south and the Tashi Palkhiel village in the north of Pokhara are renowned for the production and trade of woolen carpets and other handicrafts. The original Tibetan settlers in this region migrated to Nepal in the ‘50s.&lt;/p&gt;"";i:7;s:896:""&lt;p&gt;Wake up early to catch the sunrise from Sarangkot Hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarangkot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A drive of 45 minutes with 25 minutes hike brings us to the view point of Sarangkot. It is the best spot in Pokhara to view the Himalayas. Get mesmerized with the magical sight of the golden sun rising over white spires of the Annapurna range, Dhaulagiri and Machhapucchre (Fishtail Peak), including views of the beautiful the Pokhara Valley and Phewa Lake. It takes about 15-minute walk down and 45 minutes’ drive to the hotel in Pokhara. Return to hotel for breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drive to Chitwan National Park afterward. Upon reaching Chitwan National Park resort, you would be briefed by our Guest Relations Officer. After the lunch you would be going for Village tour. Meanwhile the dinner would be ready by the time you return to the resort.&lt;/p&gt;"";i:8;s:497:""&lt;p&gt;An early morning wake-up call followed by tea/coffee. The early morning tour provides you one of the best times to see the wildlife at its best with bird watching, jeep safari and jungle walk. After breakfast a 45-minute walk through the grassland and forest upstream of the Narayani River. Climb aboard the local boats to observe crocodiles along the banks while floating back to the camp to enjoy lunch. Late afternoon you would be entertained with the Tharu Cultural Program.&lt;/p&gt;"";i:9;s:357:""&lt;p&gt;An early morning wake-up call followed by tea/coffee. After morning tea we would be going for bird watching as Chitwan is very famous also for the different species of the birds, which is the attracting fact for the visitor. After that we would be back to resort, have breakfast and get ready to head back to Kathmandu by tourist vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;"";i:10;s:2006:""&lt;p&gt;Your sightseeing trip will start after breakfast. We provide a private vehicle and a professional tour guide. The places we visit are UNESCO World Heritage Sites of:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boudhanath Stupa &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It lies about 6 kms east of Kathmandu and is the largest stupa in the valley. It looms 36 meters high and presents one of the most fascinating specimens of stupa design. Buddhanath is also known as Khasti, or dew drops, after an account that builders had to use dew to mix the mortar as Kathmandu was suffering from a severe drought during the construction of Bouddhanath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swayambhunath Stupa – The Monkey Temple &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The temple watches over the valley from the top of a hillock on its western side. The huge stupa is one of the holiest Buddhist sites in Nepal and its establishment is linked to the creation of the Kathmandu Valley out of a primordial lake. Swayambhu is also known as Samhengu and the Monkey temple because of the countless monkeys living in the premises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pashupatinath Temple &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pashupatinath is one of the most sacred Hindu shrines in the world and lies 5 kms east of the city center. The richly-ornamented pagoda houses the sacred Linga, or phallic symbol, of Lord Shiva. Chronicles indicate the temple’s existence prior to 400 AD. Devotees can be seen taking ritual dips in the holy Bagmati River flowing beside the temple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kathmandu Durbar Square &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This complex of palaces, courtyards and temples, built between the 12th and 18th centuries, used to be the seat of the ancient Malla kings of Kathmandu. An intriguing piece here is the 17th- century stone inscription set into the wall of the palace with writings in 15 languages. The Durbar Square is the social, religious and urban focal point of the city. There are also three museums inside the palace building.&lt;/p&gt;"";i:11;s:736:""&lt;p&gt;Early in the morning, you will be transferred to the domestic airport for your Everest flight. The one-hour flight takes you within the camera range of some of the highest peaks in the world, and cruising this close to the awe-inspiring massifs of rock and ice, is an out-of-this-world experience. This special mountain flight offers the closest possible aerial views of Mt. Everest, Kanchenjunga and many other giants, as well as the Tibetan Plateau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After returning to Kathmandu, you have the afternoon and the evening to stroll along the streets of Kathmandu for some last-minute shopping.

Mardi Himal Trek is not much challenging and has good trails. Few of the times, the sections are quite steep but at the other times, the ridges are grassy and easy to walk. The maximum altitude for the trek is 4500m at the viewpoint or the Mardi Himal Base Camp. The panoramic view of the mountains Annapurna South and Machhapuchhre (Fishtail) will make you feel heavenly and rejuvenate the tired body. This trek will also impress you with the flora, fauna, wildlife, the green rich forests of Oak and Maple and the gorgeous national flower Rhododendron along the trails. Mardi Himal trek is simply the best trek not only for the views of the mountains but also to discover the traditional village life and the true countryside of Nepal.

The trail is slightly downhill from Base Camp to Pothana (1950 m) and again ascends to Deurali (2100 m). At Deurali there is a signboard pointing towards right saying “Forest Camp”. This will be the path we follow to reach the destination. The trail enters a quiet jungle of oak trees, maples, rhododendrons etc. After walking for few more hours, we reach Forest Camp.&lt;/p&gt;"";i:5;s:434:""&lt;p&gt;After walking a steep climb for about few hours, we are out of the forest and onto a grassy ridge. The ridge is sometimes full of snow. The mountains seem to grow closer to you as you walk towards the Low Camp. After walking for around 6 to 7 hours you reach Low Camp at the afternoon. Enjoying a good sip of tea, you can acclimatize and capture the best views of the up close Annapurna South and Mt. Machhapuchhre.&lt;/p&gt;"";i:6;s:429:""&lt;p&gt;We wake up early this day for the beautiful view of sunrise through the mountains. After early breakfast, we head on to the trekking trails. We walk on the grassy ridges which during winters are filled with snow. The trail ascends throughout the walk up to the High Camp. We walk above the tree line and the temperature reduces along the path. After walking for almost 4 to 5 hours, we finally reach High Camp.&lt;/p&gt;"";i:7;s:568:""&lt;p&gt;Today we wake up early and walk for few hours to reach the Mardi Himal Base Camp. The view of the Annapurna Sanctuary can be clearly seen. The panoramic scenes of South face of Mt. Annpaurna and Mt. Machhapuchhre (Fishtail) will be worth every steps taken to the Base Camp. After spending few hours here, we return back to the High Camp for lunch. After having lunch and resting for some time at High camp, we walk down to Low Camp from where it is about an hour or two’s walk to Badaldanda. We will be staying at the teahouse at Badaldanda today.&lt;/p&gt;"";i:8;s:404:""&lt;p&gt;After breakfast we start walking towards Forest Camp from where we will be taking a side trail down to the beautiful village of Landruk. The elevation changes drastically while walking down to Landruk. Landruk is a Gurung village with traditional houses that witnesses the immensely beautiful view of snow peak Annapurna South. After walking for around 6 to hours we reach the village.&lt;/p&gt;"";i:9;s:318:""&lt;p&gt;Today is the last day of trekking. We start our day with a descent down the trail to Syauli Bazar. The hike will be quite tough with many steep steps down. On arrival at Syauli Bazar we drive to Pokhara in a public vehicle. Upon reaching Pokhara, we celebrate the successful trek to the Mardi Himal.&lt;/p&gt;"";i:10;s:423:""&lt;p&gt;We head out for Kathmandu in a tourist bus. Enjoying the last glimpse of the beautiful Himalayas, we return back to Kathmandu. The journey will be of 7 total hours. Upon arrival at Kathmandu, our representative will meet and transfer you back to the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the evening we will have a farewell dinner in a traditional Nepalese restaurant with cultural performances.&lt;/p&gt;"";i:11;s:157:""&lt;p&gt;The trip ends, our Airport Representative will drop you to the Kathmandu International Airport for your final flight departure from Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;"";}}s:4:""cost"";a:6:{s:14:""includes_title"";s:9:""Inclusive"";s:13:""cost_includes"";s:901:""Airport / Hotel / Airport pick up &amp; drop off service by private tourist vehicle.

 	&lt;li&gt;Leads you to the home of brave and legendary Sherpa people&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Offers the finest panoramic views of Mt. Makalu, Mt. Cho Oyu, Mt. Lhotse.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;"";s:10:""5_wpeditor"";s:5141:""&lt;h4&gt;Porter-supported trek&lt;/h4&gt;
Two clients share one porter. We will supply you a trek duffel bag where you keep your heavy items and this bag is carried by the porter. You will need to bring your own daypack to be carried by you. In the daypack, you can put money, important documents, water bottle/bladder, camera, toiletries, sunscreen, notebook, etc.
&lt;h4&gt;Baggage weight limit&lt;/h4&gt;
The weight limit for Kathmandu-Lukla-Kathmandu flights is 15 kg or 33 pounds. This is combining both the duffel bag and the daypack. If you exceed this limit, you will have to pay an additional fee. When this happens, sometimes the airline sends your bag in later flights and this can be very problematic for many reasons. So, we recommend you to pack as carefully as you can and not exceed the weight limit. You can leave your non-trekking stuff at the locker facility in the Kathmandu hotel.

Pashupatinath Temple:
Pashupatinath Temple is one of the most significant Hindu temples of Lord Shiva in the world, located on the banks of the Bagmati River. Though you are not allowed to go inside the temple as it is strictly for Hindus only, you can clearly see the temple and the activities from the eastern bank of the Bagmati River. It is a square two-tiered pagoda temple built on a single-tier plinth which is famous all over the world.

Boudhanath Stupa:
Boudhananath is one of the holiest Buddhist sites in Kathmandu. It was built in the 5th century with four pairs of eyes of Lord Buddha in four cardinal directions keeping an eternal watch over the people and their doings. You will find Buddhist pilgrims from Tibet going round the stupa spinning the prayer wheels.

Bhaktapur Durbar Square:
Visit the Bhaktapur Durbar Square, the Royal Residential Quarter of Bhupatindra Malla, famous five-storied temple of Nyatapola in Pagoda style Batsala temple, Bhairavnath temple, Dattatreya temple, Pujari Muth and Palace of 55 windows.

On arrival at the airport, the guide will brief you and introduce our porters before we begin our trek towards Phakding (2610m).

Two clients share one porter. We will supply you a trek duffel bag where you keep your heavy items and this bag is carried by the porter. You will need to bring your own daypack to be carried by you. In the daypack, you can put money, important documents, water bottle/bladder, camera, toiletries, sunscreen, notebook, etc.
&lt;h4&gt;Baggage weight limit&lt;/h4&gt;
The weight limit for Kathmandu-Lukla-Kathmandu flights is 15 kg or 33 pounds. This is combining both the duffel bag and the daypack. If you exceed this limit, you will have to pay an additional fee. When this happens, sometimes the airline sends your bag in later flights and this can be very problematic for many reasons. So, we recommend you to pack as carefully as you can and not exceed the weight limit. You can leave your non-trekking stuff at the locker facility in the Kathmandu hotel.

1600,"60 mins Hot Air Ballooning in Pokhara","Pokhara is one of the most popular locations in Nepal for hot ballooning.  It’s also one of the few places in the world you can balloon almost all year round. Trips run in boiling hot summers and snowy winters – and the landscape looks incredible in both. While on a flight, you won’t just see a few balloons, the sky will be filled with around 50 balloons of different colors and designs. Every day is like a fiesta.

&lt;h4&gt;Porter-supported trek&lt;/h4&gt;
Two clients share one porter. We will supply you a trek duffel bag where you keep your heavy items and this bag is carried by the porter. You will need to bring your own daypack to be carried by you. In the daypack, you can put money, important documents, water bottle/bladder, camera, toiletries, sunscreen, notebook, etc.

&lt;strong&gt;Baggage weight limitation&lt;/strong&gt;

The weight limit for Kathmandu-Lukla-Kathmandu flights is 15 kg or 33 pounds. This is combining both the duffel bag and the daypack. If you exceed this limit, you will have to pay an additional fee. When this happens, sometimes the airline sends your bag in later flights and this can be very problematic for many reasons. So, we recommend you to pack as carefully as you can and not exceed the weight limit. You can leave your non-trekking stuff at the locker facility in the Kathmandu hotel.

Kathmandu Durbar Square

This complex of palaces, courtyards and temples, built between the 12th and 18th centuries, used to be the seat of the ancient Malla kings of Kathmandu. An intriguing piece here is the 17th- century stone inscription set into the wall of the palace with writings in 15 languages. The Durbar Square is the social, religious and urban focal point of the city. There are also three museums inside the palace building.

Swayambhunath Stupa – The Monkey Temple

The stupa watches over the valley from the top of a hillock on its western side. The huge white-domed stupa is one of the holiest Buddhist sites in Nepal and its establishment is linked to the creation of the Kathmandu Valley out of a primordial lake. Swoyambhu is also known as ‘Samhengu’ and the Monkey temple because of the countless monkeys living in the premises."";i:3;s:626:""Approx: 45 minutes flight to Lukla 2,800m (2 -3 hrs walk) to Phakding at 2,652m.

From Shanasa, Gokyo route diverts from the main trail towards north. The path climbs gently on the steep rock steps embedded in a narrow cleft in a large boulder; the two trails soon join and continue towards a large Chorten on the top of the ridge at Mong (3973m).

So you are briefed to pack items in two different bags.
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Biking Equipments&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Helmet&lt;/li&gt;

 	&lt;li class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Biking glasses&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Padded cycling shorts (to last at least 5 rides)&lt;/li&gt;

 	&lt;li class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Head torch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
If you’re bringing your own bike:
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Brake pads specific to your bike x 2 sets&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Rear mech hanger specific to your bike x 2&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Bottle of dry lube&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Four inner tubes, or spare bottle of fluid for&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;tubeless tyres (two for each tyre)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Quick link to suit your chain&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;For 29” wheels bring extra spare tubes; these are more difficult to find in Nepal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;General&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;4 seasons Sleeping bag (we can provide one if you need it but is to be returned after the trek)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Duffel or Rucksack bag or suitcase&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Daypack&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Down Jacket only if you are traveling in the cold season i.e January, February, November and December (Optional/we can provide if you need one but is to be returned after the trek)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Upper Body - Head / Ears / Eyes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Shade hat or baseball cap – some people drape a bandana down the back of their head and then put a baseball cap on to hold it. This can be a flexible alternative while keeping the sun off your ears and neck.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Warm wool or synthetic hat that covers your ears (only if you are traveling in the cold season i.e January, February, November and December)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Goggles or sunglasses for sunbeam, dust and wind.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Headlamp – Black Diamond and Petzl both make several good ones. Make sure to bring extra batteries and that they are lithium batteries so that they will last in the colder temperatures. These are indispensable for getting around at night, reading, etc. so, don’t go cheap here.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Some people like earmuffs; These are optional; a good hat, balaclava, and hooded jacket should really be sufficient, but this is a personal choice for some people.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;A neck warmer is another piece of gear for extra warmth if you feel you will need it and is for cold season.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Hand&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair liner gloves, thin wool or synthetic, useful alone on mild days or as a layer inside other gloves / mitts for additional warmth.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair warm gloves (This is required if you are traveling in cold season i.e January, February, November and December).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Instant hand warmers are always nice in a pinch, but really shouldn’t be necessary on the trek. Bringing appropriate hand protection as recommended above, should be sufficient (optional).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Core Body&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;T-shirts (2).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Fleece jacket or pullover.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Fleece Windstopper jacket.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Waterproof (preferably breathable fabric) shell jacket.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 women sports bras, Synthetic, no cotton!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Lower Body – Legs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 pairs nylon hiking shorts – Quick drying type, not cotton!&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Underwear, stay away from cotton (4).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 pairs lightweight long underwear – Capilene or other synthetic.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair soft shell pants – synthetic, full zip from top and bottom preferable.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 pairs trekking pants, preferably that zip on/off at the knees so they double as shorts..&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair cotton pants (loose jeans/khakis).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt; All clothing should be kept dry using waterproof stuff sacks or large puncture resistant plastic bags.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Feet&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 pairs of liner socks, synthetic or Capilene.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 pairs heavy weight socks to be worn over liner socks preferable for cold season.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 pair light weight socks, a good option for the lower / warmer parts of the trail.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair light to medium weight waterproof hiking/trekking boots. Ensure a good fit with layered socks and you have worn them before to get used to it (otherwise you will get lots of blister).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair light trekking shoes or sneakers. Good for around the camp/lodges and in Kathmandu.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair hiking gaiters, good for keeping dust and rocks out of your shoes / boots as well as keep your feet dry as necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair sandals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;First Aid Kits&lt;/h4&gt;
Please note our guide will also carry the first aid kit bag during the trek. However, we still recommend you to bring your personal first aid kit as well.
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Extra Strength Excedrin for altitude related headaches.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Ibuprofen for general aches and pains.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Immodium or Pepto Bismol capsules for upset stomach or diarrhea.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Diamox (commonly prescribed as Acetazolamide) 125 or 250mg tablets for altitude sickness. Please discuss with us before starting to take this medicine.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 small personal sized first-aid kit with blister treatments such as mole skin, band-aids, some waterproof tape, anti-infection ointments, etc. Your guides will have more extensive medical gear, but you should have the basics for general use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Passport and extra passport photos (4 copies).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Airline ticket (Please make a copy and leave on at our office in KTM just in case if you need to change the date of your).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Durable wallet/pouch for travel documents, money &amp;amp; passport.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Lip balm. At least SPF 20, 2 sticks. A string taped to the stick is helpful, to hang around your neck and some are now being sold with a cord already attached. Handy as it avoids you from having to stop and look for it.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Sunscreen. SPF 40 is recommended and should be relatively new since it loses its’ effectiveness over time.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Pocket knife or small Swiss Army type.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Water purification Iodine tablets or Polar-pure crystals.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Toiletry kit. Be sure to include toilet paper stored in a plastic bag, hand wipes, and liquid hand sanitizer, towel, soap, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;2 bandanas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;section__heading&quot;&gt;Optional&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 pair adjustable trekking poles. Although these are listed as optional, these can be of great assistance to people who may think of themselves and generally clumsy or with bad knees, ankles, etc, especially when going downhill&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Favorite snack foods, no more than 2 lbs&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Paperback books, cards, mp3 player (there are a couple of stops where you could recharge. Avoid players with moving hardware as it may not function.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Binoculars&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 light weight point &amp;amp; shoot camera or 1 large SLR. Digital cameras are ok, but you must keep the batteries warm when not in use&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Hydration bladder with the drinking tube and tube insulator&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;A pee bottle for men and pee funnel for the women&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;1 small stainless steel thermos&lt;/li&gt;

Our Tour Officer will ask for your International flight ticket and your passport for safekeeping and for reconfirmation of your outbound flight.

A completely forbidden City until very recent times, Lhasa was Holy Grail for many central Asian explorers of past generations. The City has of course been altered by the Chinese occupation and the impact of  foreign visitors. However much of the original character remains and whilst jostling through the Potala with crowds of ethnic Tibetans, it is hard not to be captivated by this magnificent civilisation. Visit to the great monasteries of Sera and Drepung, both of which were extensively destroyed in the cultural revolution but are now being rebuilt. We will also visit the Jokhang and of course the Potala. Lhasa is at 3,600m /12,000ft and provides an ideal acclimation for the first few days.  The relatively comfortable hotel will give members some time to get to know each other without the stress of moving."";i:5;s:38:""Continue to explore the city of Lhasa."";i:6;s:38:""Continue to explore the city of Lhasa."";i:7;s:1284:""After the good acclimatization at Lhasa, adventure begins with a relatively level and gradual stage, towards the bottom of the Khamba-la. Just before this great ride we pack our excess gear onto our support vehicle. Taking with us only the things that are necessary for the day biking that's water bottles, camera, wind jacket. 

Near to Lhasa the road is fairly good, but one should be careful, as this area is covered in a particular thorn bush that might get into the tyres.
The ride continues through the good road passing through the rural farm villages and fields and the traffic on the road coming to and from Lhasa, Gonggar airport, Tsedang or from Shigatse.

This beautiful day ride carries on to have lunch after a good 40 kilometers run finding a suitable spot away from the crowd of villagers and from the wind.

On arrival at Jumla our trekking staffs will receive you, who have walked all the way from Nepalgunj with the camping gear and food supply taking 5-6 days. Jumla is the largest upland town in the Karnali District, Nepal's most sparsely-populated adminstrative zone with no roads communication and is only accessible on foot or by air. 

We will have time to explore Jumla to see the bazaar and temple dedicated to Chandan Nath, a mythical saint who defeated serpents demon and emptied the lake which flooded the valley. Some half an hour's walk from Jumla towards the college is the small village of Micha where, in a small walled enclosure, stand a number of stone stupas telling of the Buddhist history. The stupas were erected in memory of important dignitaries of the region and date back from the late 15th century. From here we take a short walk climbing away from the Jumla Valley to the campsite at Charya Chaur high above the Karnali Technical College."";i:5;s:446:""Our day start with a morning climb through birch and pine forests to the unnamed grassy pass sometime known as Jaljala. As the walk progress view of Kanjiroba himal can be seen to the east, with its twin peaks that towers over the adjacent area. At afternoon we descent of about 870m through beautiful forests and find a suitable spot for overnight camping on the pastures with a nearby Shepard's hut after a relatively moderate day on the trail."";i:6;s:1335:""Our morning walk completes the descent to Sinja by following the Jaljala Khola downstream through forests with immense gnarled pines and through terraced farmland. Just before the final descent to Sinja the trail passes the 300 year old Kanaksundari Temple where ancient stone lions guard the inner sanctum. Sinja was once the ancient and thriving winter capital of the Malla kings and a few Malla stones dating from the medieval Khasa kingdom can still be seen alongside the trail on its steep, low knob. The trail passes south of the peaked, white temple and descends to the main river, crossing a thick plant bridge at a place where the water has cut a deep, narrow furrow through bedrock. Sinja village rests upon a small alluvial plain on the west bank of the clear Lah Gad River, here called the Sinja River. 

The ruined town actually stood on the east bank of the Sinja Khola, at a place known as Kotgaon or Lamathada, where you can poke among ancient sculptured stones overgrown with weeds. Just north of Sinja stone-bound aeries once used by meditating re-annunciates are visible along the rock walls.

Sinja was once the ancient and thriving winter capital of the Malla kings and a few Malla stones dating from the medieval Khasa kingdom can still be seen alongside the trail on its steep, low knob. The trail passes south of the peaked, white temple and descends to the main river, crossing a thick plant bridge at a place where the water has cut a deep, narrow furrow through bedrock.

Two clients share one porter. We will supply you a trek duffel bag where you keep your heavy items and this bag is carried by the porter. You will need to bring your own daypack to be carried by you. In the daypack, you can put money, important documents, water bottle/bladder, camera, toiletries, sunscreen, notebook, etc. The weight limit for the porter is 30 kg or 66 pounds. 15 kg or 33 pounds for each client. So, we recommend you to pack as carefully as you can and not exceed the weight limit. You can leave your non-trekking stuff at the locker facility in the Kathmandu hotel.

6551,"Short Everest View Trek","This short Everest base camp trip is designed for those travelers with very limited time, yet who have an enduring desire to wave the almighty Everest. On this short Everest Base camp trek, you will be able to experience astounding mountain views.

Everest Short Trek starts with an exhilarating Himalayan flight towards Lukla from Kathmandu. Then we continue our trek towards Khumbu Region. The trek offers you to explore the culture and lifestyle of legendary and brave mountain climbers ‘Sherpa’ in the Namche Bazaar. Namche Bazaar is the popular trading center of the Everest region and also the one and only gateway to Everest.

We will settle the majority of our trek in Khumbu Region. It offers you the excellent views of Khumbu ranges and ice floating Khumbu glacier-fed lakes. Breakfast in the Everest View hotel treats you with the nose-tip view of the great Mount Everest.

6552,"Panorama Panchase Family Trek","Panchase trek is an easier trek. Each day of hiking day is not more than 3 to 4 hours which make it ideal for the hikers with moderate fitness, beginning trekkers, as well as kids.

Unlike other treks in Annapurna foothill, Panchase trek sets off with an early morning stimulating boating across Phewa Lake. After crossing, we start our uphill trek towards World Peace Pagoda through lush green forests.

The third-day trek to Panchase Peak is significant which treats you with the amazing views of Gangapurna, Machhapuchhre, Dhaulagiri, Annapurna I, and Annapurna south with the delicious lunch.

The trek is completed as you descend down through the jeep trail of Naudada to Pokhara and Kathmandu.",,20190331,trip,http://trekkingtopnepal.com/trip/panorama-panchase-family-trek/,http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/6636212009_df0076f6f0_o.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/5192001083_713e8f4b38_b.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/5192342046_15524f9ef8_b.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/5496298781_4e4a808bab_o.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/6134288826_d1c7e5e622_b.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/8620351986_4c59e0524d_k.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/11500577745_c4a4b9d864_k.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/14508238632_110af6ea8d_b.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/16978231910_3ad1e1d28e_k.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/27575773929_24a85823d8_b.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/38474810935_a42f65e83e_b.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/38474813165_5bc9eea0f4_b.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/panchese-trek.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/3575695062_672bbaf351_o.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/4699484138_9db3388dc7_o.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/5168730081_46827e7fb2_o.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/6608786565_c9a5e4f9c2_o.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/6615239187_e69aecb8cb_o.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/6628750303_79c4a85f31_o-1.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/6629333721_a79e815015_o.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/6635430077_53dc6dd010_b.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/6636214661_3bc9ff5da9_o.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/6636766851_5b5bd1ddaf_o.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/6637189723_f0697a9f10_o.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/13123632695_93162b40bc_o.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/16112753645_7087e057e8_o.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/16127656344_5ad97bec54_h.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20582458764_118791e91f_k.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20584000193_533ca57738_o.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/21178915986_c9d92c98b0_k.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/26844743059_3863f06592_o.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/37903592374_ef014bde5e_o.jpg,"6636212009_df0076f6f0_o|5192001083_713e8f4b38_b|5192342046_15524f9ef8_b|5496298781_4e4a808bab_o|6134288826_d1c7e5e622_b|8620351986_4c59e0524d_k|11500577745_c4a4b9d864_k|14508238632_110af6ea8d_b|16978231910_3ad1e1d28e_k|27575773929_24a85823d8_b|38474810935_a42f65e83e_b|38474813165_5bc9eea0f4_b|panchese trek|3575695062_672bbaf351_o|4699484138_9db3388dc7_o|5168730081_46827e7fb2_o|6608786565_c9a5e4f9c2_o|6615239187_e69aecb8cb_o|6628750303_79c4a85f31_o (1)|6629333721_a79e815015_o|6635430077_53dc6dd010_b|6636214661_3bc9ff5da9_o|6636766851_5b5bd1ddaf_o|6637189723_f0697a9f10_o|Day 5 - From Sarankot to Pokhara|DSC_0766|Makanpur Village|20582458764_118791e91f_k|20584000193_533ca57738_o|21178915986_c9d92c98b0_k|26844743059_3863f06592_o|37903592374_ef014bde5e_o","||||||||||||||||||||||||Day 5 - From Sarankot to Pokhara||Traditional small village below Panchase, Kaski, Nepal|||||",|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||,|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||,http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/6636212009_df0076f6f0_o.jpg,,"Himalayas>Annapurna Region","Natural &amp; Landscapes>TREKKING","Trip Level>Beginner|Budget>Between $500 - $1000|Duration>within a week trip","a:6:{s:8:""og_title"";s:29:""Panorama Panchase Family Trek"";s:7:""og_desc"";s:160:""Panchase trek is an easier trek.

7272,"Music & Trekking to Upper Mustang Tiji Festival Trek","Tiji Festival is a colorful festival celebrated in the Lo Manthang region of Upper Mustang (3840  m). This festival holds a significant place on the truest mountain people who follow Tibetan Buddhist culture. Tiji Festival is celebrated for three days every year at the beginning of the harvest season. This spring-renewal festival marks the celebration of the triumph of good over evil. In a local ritual, they celebrate this festival to chase away the demons.

During this festival, people gather together and express themselves in different ways with traditional colorful customs with hideous masks, dance, and music. They show the drama of deity winning over the demon believing that the demons are chased away from their place. They chant their prayers and remember their god. Even the monks wear their traditional customs and present themselves in vibrant colors; red, yellow, blue and with their multicultural flags which makes the entire ambiance appealing and lively.

Upper Mustang Tiji festival trek coincides with the combination of the dramatic Himalayan desert with the magnificent views of massive Dhaulagiri, Annapurna, and Nilgiri ranges at the backdrop. Trekking through the world's deepest gorge, Kaligandaki Gorge and high vibrant walls of Mustang villages, exploring the centuries back lifestyle of people add a significant cultural and geographical highlight.

This year the Tiji Festival will be celebrated on 30th, 31st May, and 1st June 2019. We offer a fixed departure for this trip. If you find this trip appealing, you may reserve with Osho World Adventure. We are committed to making your travel reliable, safe, comfortable, and affordable.",,20190409,trip,http://trekkingtopnepal.com/trip/music-and-trekking-upper-mustang-tiji-festival-trek-to-lo-manthang/,http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/34308120604_268f9c14df_b.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/545546528_6db05f052c_z.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/545862486_738097e773_z.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/545863662_ebb6532221_z.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/545903039_a41e4e8dc8_z.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/546129203_881cc3e115_z.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/566401777_0caa91657f_z.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/4106058060_5de8cef164_z.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/7249074942_458f2feb5e_k.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/7320303816_47ee06c4c2_o.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/14201286428_d331c00fcf_b.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/14201341660_13be521d4c_b.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/14376085251_06ef17528d_b.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/14376165941_3e39b64a60_b.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/14377978822_253efaed78_b.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/14378057802_d38b046b3d_b.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/14440064104_fba64bd6fd_b.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/14441181445_72611184c5_b.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/24616316168_14cc66e900_k.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/29409211245_10e54aa9e2_k.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/35011266712_bc42c384c7_b.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/35045356621_e5a08718b8_h.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/46211144524_9903a28db2_o.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mustangtiji.jpg,"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA|545546528_6db05f052c_z|545862486_738097e773_z|545863662_ebb6532221_z|545903039_a41e4e8dc8_z|546129203_881cc3e115_z|566401777_0caa91657f_z|4106058060_5de8cef164_z|7249074942_458f2feb5e_k|7320303816_47ee06c4c2_o|14201286428_d331c00fcf_b|14201341660_13be521d4c_b|14376085251_06ef17528d_b|14376165941_3e39b64a60_b|14377978822_253efaed78_b|14378057802_d38b046b3d_b|14440064104_fba64bd6fd_b|14441181445_72611184c5_b|24616316168_14cc66e900_k|29409211245_10e54aa9e2_k|OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA|OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA|46211144524_9903a28db2_o|mustangtiji","OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA||||||||||||||||||||OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA|OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA||",|||||||||||||||||||||||,|||||||||||||||||||||||,http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/34308120604_268f9c14df_b.jpg,,"Himalayas>Mustang Region","Natural &amp; Landscapes>TREKKING","Duration>2-3 weeks trip|Budget>Between $2000 - $2500|Trip Level>Moderate","a:6:{s:8:""og_title"";s:52:""Music & Trekking to Upper Mustang Tiji Festival Trek"";s:7:""og_desc"";s:160:""Tiji Festival is a colorful festival celebrated in the Lo Manthang region of Upper Mustang (3840  m).

7407,"Lower Dolpo Trekking to Shey Phoksundo Lake","Lower Dolpo Trek offers a spectacular trail through a mix of forest and beautiful traditional villages in the shadow of rain located behind Dhaulagiri range. This range is highly populated yet provides overwhelming insight into the lives of people out there. The people in this area are fond of Buddhist beliefs and strongly follows it. This is also one of the few areas where the Pre-Buddhist Bon Po religion is still practiced, which is disappeared even from Tibet in the 9th century.

In this trek, we will be passing two high regions Numa la(5190 m), Baga la (5070), and then we reach to explore the elegance of Shey-Phoksundo (3611.5 m), which is an alpine freshwater Oligotrophic lake. It is the deepest and second large lake in Nepal which lies in the periphery of Shey-Phokshundo National Park. Trekking through this area you will encounter some of the overwhelming species of animals such as Blue sheep, Musk deer, Snow leopard, Ghoral, Himalayan tahr and many more.

7587,"Balthali Village Homestay Trek","Balthali is a small, sleepy yet admiring village which rests at the junction of Roshi and Ladku Khola river. It stands on the plateau which is just beyond Khopasi, 40km away from Kathmandu.

Balthali is one of the highest points in the Mahabharat range. We can reach the resort after an hour’s walk from Khopasi, till where we can drive. If you walk from Panauti, it will take about two hours to reach Balthali. There is a beautiful resort in Balthali from you can observe great mountain views in the north attractive spans of the Terai plains in the south. This appealing village is surrounded by lush green hills and layered rice terrains.

Balthali is a place where you can mainly find Newar tribes of people who have kept their traditions and way of life for several generations. You can live here with a completely local family where you will have an opportunity to observe their day-to-day activities and share moments with them.

There are numbers of excellent short and long hikes inside Panauti Valley that takes you to explore many religious sites such as NamoBuddha, Indreshwar Mahadev and Brahmayani, etc.

7588,"Kakani Village Homestay Trek","Kakani Village is nation-widely famous for bird watching, trout fish-farming and for its amazing Himalayan view. Just an hour scenic drive towards the north of Kathmandu Valley takes us to Kakani Village, which is situated at an altitude of 2073m.

Kakani Village is truly an ideal place to explore the typical Nepali village lifestyle, people and culture. During the spring season, the forests at the hillside will be covered by vibrant colors of rhododendron flowers, maple, orchids, and appealing coniferous pine forests. The magnificent views of mountain ranges stretching from Annapurna to Everest, via Ganesh Himal, Manaslu, Gaurishankar and Dorje Lakpa at the northern highlands makes this place absolutely a precious treasure to gaze over the Himalayan sunrise and sunset view from Kakani Hill tower.

The sense of visiting is place is slower and quieter devoid of distractions. And if you love strawberries, Kakani is the right choice for you. Every year Kakani produces 250,000 kg of strawberries.

They are totally untouched by modernization that they are still completely away from present society.

This tour takes you to the unexplored hillside of Dhading and Chitwan districts of Nepal through high waterfalls, valleys, dramatic landscapes, and panoramic mountain views. In this homestay tour, we will experience the nomadic lifestyle of the indigenous Chepang communities who are rich in their own language and tradition which is completely different from the rest of the Nepalese society. Due to this distinct lifestyle and remoteness, they fall under the marginalized group of people in Nepal.

7755,"Nepal Buddhist Pilgrimage Tour","The birthplace of Lord Buddha, Lumbini is a sacred place for Buddhists from all over the world, standing on an equal footing with holy places sacred to other world religions. The sacred garden where Buddha was born converges into the Ashoka pillar, which carries an inscription identifying the birth spot where we can see the seven footsteps of the Budhha.

Maya Devi Temple is located close to the Ashoka pillar, which is named after his mother Mayadevi. The statue of Maya Devi is made out of the stone which is believed to be 2000 years old. To the south of Maya Devi Temple, there is Puskar pond where Maya Devi took a bath before giving birth to Buddha. Lord Buddha is also believed to get a purifying bath in the same pond.

The whole area of Lumbini is considered as a garden. Many appealing monasteries have been built through the help of different countries such as Thailand, Srilanka, and Japan. It is considered as the International Centre for the Buddhist pilgrimage.

The Lumbini Museum has a large collection of the Mauryan and Kushana coins, religious manuscripts, terracotta fragments, stones, and metal sculptures. Also on display is an extensive collection of stamps from various countries depicting Lumbini and Buddha.",,20190418,trip,http://trekkingtopnepal.com/trip/nepal-buddhist-pilgrimage-tour/,http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/32432734131_fe1de74d22_b.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/4347523434_ce5e5a6406_b.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/5133302273_69634932a1_b-1.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/7064389319_c1793eafe7_h.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/7857858616_e422e3f979_k.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/8589161206_308fbd7bc5_k.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/8636294121_b5850284b6_b.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/8674175812_ff7b2ff0f5_b.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/9238107702_fdf7c3948f_k.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/9458059719_bcbc30a9c6_b.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/9623976942_9b979eab72_k.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/9638908783_e0b516c8a3_b.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/9645508970_228810480a_o.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/10360206874_e5aa603882_k.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/13652310783_9cb15f9cab_b.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/13982909659_adb49a736b_k.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/14095744083_50c3cd0aa7_k.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/14210148991_3e35e07e99_k.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/24126858148_dfae4242bc_k.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/26513974989_5f692ef6ed_b.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/27488856621_70a8d00be2_o.jpg|http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/38105882516_52c53e4d32_k.jpg,"32432734131_fe1de74d22_b|4347523434_ce5e5a6406_b|5133302273_69634932a1_b|7064389319_c1793eafe7_h|namobuddha|8589161206_308fbd7bc5_k|8636294121_b5850284b6_b|8674175812_ff7b2ff0f5_b|9238107702_fdf7c3948f_k|9458059719_bcbc30a9c6_b|9623976942_9b979eab72_k|9638908783_e0b516c8a3_b|9645508970_228810480a_o|Buddhist Gompa in Jharkot|SONY DSC|13982909659_adb49a736b_k|14095744083_50c3cd0aa7_k|14210148991_3e35e07e99_k|24126858148_dfae4242bc_k|OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA|27488856621_70a8d00be2_o|38105882516_52c53e4d32_k","||||||||||||||SONY DSC|||||OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA||",|||||||||||||||||||||,|||||||||||||||||||||,http://trekkingtopnepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/32432734131_fe1de74d22_b.jpg,,"Western &amp;
